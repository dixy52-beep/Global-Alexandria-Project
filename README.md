# Alexandria Rediviva: The Open Library of Ancient & Historical Texts

**Our Vision: To build the world's largest, freely accessible, community-driven digital library of rare, ancient, and historical books from across the globe, with a focus on Oriental, Middle Eastern, Russian, and other non-Occidental traditions.**

Inspired by the spirit of the legendary Library of Alexandria, this project aims to preserve and disseminate humanity's shared literary heritage. We leverage AI translation to bring these invaluable, copyright-free texts to a modern, global audience.

## About This Project

This repository is an open, collaborative effort to collect and share AI-translated versions of historical books that are:

*   **Ancient or Old:** Focusing on works that offer significant historical, cultural, or literary value.
*   **From Diverse Traditions:** With an emphasis on Oriental, Middle Eastern, Russian, and other non-Occidental sources often underrepresented in digital collections.
*   **Absolutely Copyright-Free:** All contributed texts **MUST** be verifiably in the public domain or free of any copyright restrictions. This is non-negotiable.
*   **AI-Translated:** Utilizing artificial intelligence to make these texts accessible in contemporary languages (primarily English to start, but other target languages are welcome).
*   **Open to All:** For reading, research, education, and pure curiosity – free for everyone, forever.

We believe that knowledge should be free and accessible. By creating this digital archive, we hope to foster a deeper understanding of diverse cultures and historical perspectives.

## How You Can Participate & Contribute

**Everyone is welcome to contribute!** This library thrives on community participation. Here's how you can help:

1.  **Add New Books:**
    *   Find an ancient or historical text that is **verifiably copyright-free**.
    *   Use an AI translation tool to translate it (please note the tool used if possible).
    *   Format it clearly (e.g., plain text `.txt` or Markdown `.md`).
    *   Submit it via a Pull Request, placing it in an appropriate folder (see "Folder Structure" below).

2.  **Verify Copyright Status:**
    *   Help ensure all existing and newly submitted texts are indeed in the public domain. Due diligence is key.

3.  **Improve Organization:**
    *   Suggest better folder structures or metadata standards.

4.  **Suggest Books for Translation:**
    *   If you know of a copyright-free ancient text that would be a great addition, open an Issue to suggest it.

5.  **Spread the Word:**
    *   Share this project with others who might be interested in reading or contributing.

## Contribution Guidelines - **IMPORTANT**

To maintain the integrity and legality of this library, please adhere to the following:

*   ✅ **COPYRIGHT-FREE ONLY:** This is the most crucial rule. **Only books that are unequivocally in the public domain or under a license that permits free distribution and modification will be accepted.** You must be reasonably sure of its status. If in doubt, do not submit.
*   **Source Material:** Prioritize original texts from ancient or significantly old historical periods.
*   **AI Translation:** While the quality of AI translation varies, the aim is accessibility. Please note if a specific AI tool was used (e.g., "Translated using Google Translate," "Translated with DeepL"). Post-editing AI translations for clarity is highly encouraged.
*   **Formatting:**
    *   Use plain text (`.txt`) or Markdown (`.md`) for submissions.
    *   Ensure reasonable formatting for readability (e.g., paragraphs, chapter breaks if applicable).
*   **Folder Structure:**
    *   Try to follow a logical structure, e.g., `Region_Or_Culture/Author_Or_Era/Book_Title.txt`.
    *   Example: `Ancient_Egypt/Papyri/Book_of_the_Dead_Ani_Papyrus_AI_Translated.txt`
    *   Example: `Medieval_Persia/Ferdowsi/Shahnameh_Excerpt_AI_Translated.md`
    *   If unsure, propose a structure in your Pull Request.
*   **Pull Requests:**
    *   Submit contributions via Pull Requests.
    *   Provide a brief description of the book, its original language (if known), why you believe it's copyright-free, and the AI tool used for translation.

## Disclaimer

## Our Goal

We aim to become the **biggest free library of rare and historical books**, powered by a global community. Let's build this together, one ancient text at a time, ensuring that the wisdom of the past remains accessible for generations to come.
