Annals of the Five Emperors:
The Yellow Emperor was the son of Shaodian. His surname was Gongsun, and his name was Xuanyuan. He was divine from birth. As an infant, he could speak. As a child, he was quick-witted. As he grew, he was honest and diligent. As an adult, he was intelligent and discerning.

Annals of the Five Emperors:
In the time of Xuanyuan, the house of Shennong had declined. The feudal lords invaded each other and oppressed the common people, but the house of Shennong was unable to suppress them. Thereupon, Xuanyuan practiced the use of shields and spears to conquer those who did not pay homage, and all the feudal lords came to pay allegiance and submit. But Chiyou was the most tyrannical, and no one could vanquish him. The Yan Emperor wished to encroach upon and oppress the feudal lords, so all the feudal lords turned to Xuanyuan. Xuanyuan then cultivated his virtue and strengthened his military, regulated the five energies, cultivated the five kinds of grain, pacified the myriad peoples, and measured the four quarters. He trained bears, brown bears, pixiu, panthers, and tigers, and with them, he fought the Yan Emperor in the wilderness of Banquan. After three battles, he achieved his aim. Chiyou rebelled and did not obey the Emperor's command. Thereupon, the Yellow Emperor summoned the armies of the feudal lords and fought Chiyou in the wilderness of Zhuolu, finally capturing and killing Chiyou. And all the feudal lords honored Xuanyuan as the Son of Heaven, replacing the house of Shennong. This was the Yellow Emperor. If there was anyone in the world who was disobedient, the Yellow Emperor would go and conquer them. Once pacified, he would depart. He cut through mountains to open roads and never rested in one place.

Annals of the Five Emperors:
To the east, he reached the sea, ascended Mount Wan and Mount Dai (Taishan). To the west, he reached Kongtong and ascended Mount Jitou. To the south, he reached the Yangtze River and ascended Mount Xiong and Mount Xiang. To the north, he drove out the Hunyu, assembled the tallies at Mount Fu, and established his capital in the bend of Zhuolu. He moved about without a fixed abode, using his army and soldiers as his encampment and guard. Official titles were all named after clouds, and he was known as the Cloud Master. He established Left and Right Grand Supervisors to oversee the myriad states. The myriad states were harmonious, and the spirits, mountains, and rivers were often offered sacrifices and enfeoffed. He obtained a precious tripod and welcomed the sun by divining with stalks. He appointed Feng Hou, Li Mu, Chang Xian, and Da Hong to govern the people. He followed the principles of Heaven and Earth, the divinations of the seen and unseen, the doctrines of life and death, and the difficulties of survival and destruction. He sowed the hundred grains, grasses, and trees at the right times, and civilized birds, beasts, insects, and moths. He comprehensively observed the sun, moon, stars, water, waves, earth, stones, gold, and jade. He diligently used his mind, strength, ears, and eyes, and economized on the use of water, fire, timber, and materials. He possessed the auspicious sign of Earth Virtue, hence he was called the Yellow Emperor.

Annals of the Five Emperors:
The Yellow Emperor had twenty-five sons, fourteen of whom received surnames.

Annals of the Five Emperors:
The Yellow Emperor resided at the Hill of Xuanyuan and married a woman from Xiling, who was Leizu. Leizu became the Yellow Emperor's principal wife and bore two sons, both of whose descendants later ruled the empire. One was named Xuanxiao, who was Qingyang. Qingyang descended to live by the Jiang River. The other was named Changyi, who descended to live by the Ruo River. Changyi married a woman from the Shushan clan, named Changpu, who bore Gaoyang. Gaoyang possessed sagely virtue. The Yellow Emperor died and was buried at Mount Qiao. His grandson, Changyi's son Gaoyang, ascended the throne; this was Emperor Zhuanxu.

Annals of the Five Emperors:
Emperor Zhuanxu Gaoyang was the grandson of the Yellow Emperor and the son of Changyi. He was serene and profound, possessing foresight; he was discerning and knowledgeable in affairs. He nurtured talent to manage the land, observed the seasons to emulate Heaven, relied on spirits and deities to establish righteousness, regulated the vital energies to teach and transform, and was pure and sincere in offering sacrifices. To the north, he reached Youling; to the south, Jiaozhi; to the west, Liusha (the flowing sands); and to the east, Panmu. All moving and stationary things, all great and small spirits, wherever the sun and moon shone, all submitted to him.

Annals of the Five Emperors:
Emperor Zhuanxu had a son named Qiongchan. Zhuanxu died, and Xuanxiao's grandson Gaoxin ascended the throne; this was Emperor Ku.

Annals of the Five Emperors:
Emperor Ku Gaoxin was the great-grandson of the Yellow Emperor. Gaoxin's father was named Jiaoji, Jiaoji's father was named Xuanxiao, and Xuanxiao's father was the Yellow Emperor. Neither Xuanxiao nor Jiaoji held the throne; it was Gaoxin who ascended the imperial throne. Gaoxin was a clansman to Zhuanxu.

Annals of the Five Emperors:
Gaoxin was divine from birth and spoke his own name. He universally bestowed benefits upon all things, not for his own sake. He was intelligent enough to know the distant and discerning enough to perceive the minute. He followed the righteousness of Heaven and understood the urgent needs of the people. He was benevolent yet awe-inspiring, generous yet trustworthy. He cultivated himself, and the world submitted. He took the wealth of the land and used it sparingly. He soothed and taught the myriad peoples and beneficially instructed them. He observed the sun and moon and saw them off and welcomed them. He understood the spirits and deities and respectfully served them. His countenance was dignified, his virtue lofty. His actions were timely, his attire that of a scholar. Emperor Ku impartially governed and extended his influence throughout the world. Wherever the sun and moon shone, wherever wind and rain reached, none failed to submit.

Annals of the Five Emperors:
Emperor Ku married a woman from the Chenfeng clan, who bore Fangxun. He married a woman from the Zuzi clan, who bore Zhi. Emperor Ku died, and Zhi succeeded him. Emperor Zhi ascended the throne but was not good (died), and his younger brother Fangxun ascended the throne; this was Emperor Yao.

Annals of the Five Emperors:
Emperor Yao was Fangxun. His benevolence was like Heaven, his wisdom like that of a god. To approach him was like approaching the sun; to look up to him was like looking up to the clouds. He was wealthy but not arrogant, noble but not indulgent. He wore yellow silk garments and rode in a red chariot drawn by white horses. He was able to manifest and cultivate virtue, thereby uniting the nine degrees of kinship. Once the nine degrees of kinship were harmonious, he distinguished the common people. Once the common people were enlightened, he brought harmony to the myriad states.

Annals of the Five Emperors:
He then ordered Xi and He to respectfully accord with High Heaven, to calculate and observe the sun, moon, and stars, and to respectfully impart the seasons to the people. He separately ordered Xi Zhong to reside in Yuyi, called Yanggu (Valley of the Sun). Respectfully guiding the sunrise, he arranged the eastern labors. At midday, with the star Niao (Bird Star), he marked mid-spring. The people dispersed, and birds and beasts mated and had young. He further ordered Xi Shu to reside in Nanjiao. Arranging the southern transformations, he respectfully managed them. When the days were longest, with the star Huo (Fire Star), he marked mid-summer. The people spread out, and birds and beasts shed their coats. He further ordered He Zhong to reside in the western lands, called Meigu (Dark Valley). Respectfully guiding the sunset, he arranged the western accomplishments. At midnight, with the star Xu (Emptiness Star), he marked mid-autumn. The people were at ease, and birds and beasts grew new fur. He further ordered He Shu to reside in the northern regions, called Youdu (Dark Capital). He was to manage the hibernating creatures. When the days were shortest, with the star Mao (Pleiades), he marked mid-winter. The people stayed warm, and birds and beasts had thick fur. The year had three hundred and sixty-six days, and an intercalary month was used to regulate the four seasons. He faithfully instructed all the officials, and all tasks flourished.

Annals of the Five Emperors:
Yao said, "Who can carry on this work?" Fang Qi said, "Your heir, Danzhu, is enlightened." Yao said, "Alas! He is obstinate and fierce; he cannot be used." Yao said again, "Who is capable?" Huandou said, "Gonggong has gathered many and spread his achievements; he can be used." Yao said, "Gonggong is skilled in speech, but his actions are perverse. He appears respectful but scorns Heaven; he cannot be used." Yao said again, "Alas, Four Mountains! The vast waters flood the heavens, surging around the mountains and submerging the hills. The common people are distressed. Is there anyone who can be made to control it?" All said Gun was capable. Yao said, "Gun disobeys orders and harms his kin; he cannot be used." The Mountains said, "It is different. Try him; if he is not capable, then dismiss him." Yao thereupon listened to the Mountains and employed Gun. For nine years, his work was not accomplished.

Annals of the Five Emperors:
Yao said, "Alas! Four Mountains: I have been on the throne for seventy years. Can you undertake my mandate and ascend my throne?" The Mountains replied, "Our meager virtue would disgrace the imperial position." Yao said, "Nominate all, whether noble relatives or distant and obscure individuals." Everyone said to Yao, "There is a widower among the common people named Yu Shun." Yao said, "Indeed, I have heard of him. What is he like?" The Mountains said, "He is the son of a blind man. His father is obstinate, his stepmother deceitful, his younger brother arrogant, yet he is able to live in harmony with them through filial piety, and his conduct is increasingly upright, never resorting to wickedness." Yao said, "I shall test him." Thereupon, Yao married his two daughters to him, to observe his virtue through them. Shun instructed his two daughters to go down to the Gui River bend and behave with wifely propriety.
Yao approved of him and then had Shun carefully harmonize the Five Cardinal Relationships, and the Five Cardinal Relationships were followed. Then he was placed in charge of all the officials, and the officials were orderly. He received guests at the four gates, and the four gates were solemn and respectful; feudal lords and guests from distant lands were all respectful. Yao sent Shun into the mountains, forests, rivers, and marshes; amidst violent winds, thunder, and rain, Shun did not lose his way. Yao considered him a sage and summoned Shun, saying, "Your counsel has been effective, and your deeds can be accomplished. It has been three years. You shall ascend the imperial throne." Shun declined out of virtue, not being pleased. On the first day of the first month, Shun received the succession in the temple of the Cultivated Ancestor. The Cultivated Ancestor was Yao's great ancestor.

Annals of the Five Emperors:
Thereupon, Emperor Yao, being old, ordered Shun to act as regent, exercising the authority of the Son of Heaven, to observe the Mandate of Heaven. Shun then used the xuanji yuhua (an astronomical instrument) to regulate the Seven Governors (sun, moon, and five planets). He then performed the lei sacrifice to the Supreme Deity, the yin sacrifice to the Six Honored Ones, the wang sacrifice to the mountains and rivers, and the bian sacrifice to the host of spirits. He gathered the five kinds of jade tokens, selected an auspicious month and day, met with the Four Mountains and the various regional chiefs, and distributed the tokens. In the second month of the year, he made an eastern tour of inspection, reaching Mount Dai (Taishan), where he made a burnt offering and performed the wang sacrifice in proper order to the mountains and rivers. He then met with the eastern lords, standardized the seasons, months, and days, and unified the musical pitches, measures of length, capacity, and weight. He revised the five rites, the five jades, the three silks, the two living animals, and the one dead animal as offerings, according to the five classes of instruments, and then returned. In the fifth month, he made a southern tour of inspection; in the eighth month, a western tour of inspection; and in the eleventh month, a northern tour of inspection: all were conducted as the first. Upon returning, he went to the ancestral temple and offered a special bull sacrifice. Every five years, there was one tour of inspection, and the feudal lords came to court four times. He informed them with words, clearly tested them with their accomplishments, and rewarded them with chariots and robes according to their merit. He established twelve provinces and dredged the rivers. He made statutes based on regular punishments, commuted the five severe punishments to banishment, made whipping the punishment for officials, caning the punishment for instructors, and fines the punishment for redemption. For accidental offenses and calamities, there was pardon; for those who persisted in evil and were incorrigible, there was execution. "Be reverent! Be reverent! Only in punishment is there tranquility!"

Annals of the Five Emperors:
Huandou recommended Gonggong. Yao said he was not acceptable but tested him as Minister of Works, and Gonggong indeed proved dissolute and perverse. The Four Mountains recommended Gun to control the great flood. Yao thought he was not acceptable, but the Mountains strongly urged that he be tried. He was tried but achieved no success, so the common people were not benefited. The San Miao in the Jiang-Huai and Jingzhou regions frequently caused rebellions. Thereupon, Shun returned and reported to the Emperor, requesting to banish Gonggong to Youling to transform the northern barbarians; to banish Huandou to Mount Chong to transform the southern barbarians; to move the San Miao to Sanwei to transform the western Rong; and to execute Gun at Mount Yu to transform the eastern Yi. These four were punished, and the whole world submitted.

Annals of the Five Emperors:
Yao had been on the throne for seventy years when he found Shun. After twenty years, he grew old and ordered Shun to act as regent, exercising the authority of the Son of Heaven, and recommended him to Heaven. Yao abdicated his position for a total of twenty-eight years before he died. The common people mourned as if they had lost their parents. For three years, no music was played in the four quarters, in memory of Yao. Yao knew that his son Danzhu was unworthy and not fit to be entrusted with the empire. Therefore, he provisionally entrusted it to Shun. If Shun were entrusted, then the empire would benefit, and Danzhu would suffer; if Danzhu were entrusted, then the empire would suffer, and Danzhu would benefit. Yao said, "I will never benefit one person at the expense of the empire," and so he finally entrusted the empire to Shun. After Yao died, and the three-year mourning period was completed, Shun yielded and retired in favor of Danzhu to the south of the Nanhe River. However, the feudal lords who came to court did not go to Danzhu but to Shun; those with lawsuits did not go to Danzhu but to Shun; and singers did not sing praises of Danzhu but of Shun. Shun said, "It is Heaven's will," and only then did he go to the capital and ascend the throne of the Son of Heaven. This was Emperor Shun.

Annals of the Five Emperors:
Yu Shun was named Chonghua. Chonghua's father was named Gusou. Gusou's father was named Qiaoniu. Qiaoniu's father was named Gouwang. Gouwang's father was named Jingkang. Jingkang's father was named Qiongchan. Qiongchan's father was Emperor Zhuanxu. Zhuanxu's father was Changyi. Thus, it was seven generations to Shun. From Qiongchan to Emperor Shun, all were obscure commoners.

Annals of the Five Emperors:
Shun's father, Gusou, was blind, and Shun's mother died. Gusou remarried and had a son, Xiang, who was arrogant. Gusou loved his second wife and son and often wanted to kill Shun. Shun avoided and fled. When he committed minor faults, he would accept punishment. He obediently served his father, stepmother, and younger brother, becoming more devoted and diligent daily, without any remission.

Annals of the Five Emperors:
Shun was a man from Jizhou. Shun farmed at Mount Li, fished at Lake Lei, made pottery on the banks of the Yellow River, and crafted utensils at Shouqiu. He sought seasonal work at Fuxia. Shun's father, Gusou, was obstinate, his stepmother deceitful, and his younger brother Xiang arrogant; they all wanted to kill Shun. Shun was obedient and accommodating, never failing in his filial duties, and treated his brother with kindness and affection. When they wanted to kill him, they could not succeed; when they sought him, he was always by their side.

Annals of the Five Emperors:
At the age of twenty, Shun was known for his filial piety. At thirty, Emperor Yao asked for capable men, and the Four Mountains all recommended Yu Shun, saying he was capable. Thereupon, Yao married his two daughters to Shun to observe his conduct within the family and sent nine sons to live with him to observe his conduct outside. Shun resided at the bend of the Gui River, and his domestic conduct became even more circumspect. Yao's two daughters did not dare to act arrogantly towards Shun's relatives because of their noble status and were very dutiful wives. Yao's nine sons all became more devoted. When Shun farmed at Mount Li, the people of Mount Li all yielded the boundaries of their fields. When he fished at Lake Lei, the people on Lake Lei all yielded their fishing spots. When he made pottery on the banks of the Yellow River, the pottery made there was not shoddy or fragile. In one year, the place where he lived became a settlement; in two years, it became a town; in three years, it became a city. Yao then bestowed upon Shun fine linen clothes and a zither, built granaries for him, and gave him cattle and sheep. Gusou still wanted to kill him. He made Shun go up to plaster a granary, and Gusou set fire to the granary from below. Shun then used two conical hats to protect himself and descended, escaping death. Later, Gusou again made Shun dig a well. Shun, while digging the well, made a hidden passage leading out to the side. When Shun had gone deep, Gusou and Xiang together threw earth down to fill the well. Shun escaped through the hidden passage. Gusou and Xiang were delighted, thinking Shun was already dead. Xiang said, "The original planner was Xiang." Xiang divided Shun's property with his parents, saying, "Shun's wives, Yao's two daughters, and the zither, Xiang will take them. The cattle, sheep, and granaries will be given to my parents." Xiang then went to live in Shun's palace and played his zither. Shun went to see him. Xiang was startled and displeased, saying, "I was just thinking of Shun with great distress!" Shun said, "Indeed, may you prosper!" Shun again served Gusou and loved his younger brother with even greater diligence. Thereupon, Yao tested Shun with the Five Cardinal Relationships and all official duties, and all were well-managed.

Annals of the Five Emperors:
In former times, Gaoyang had eight talented sons, whose generations benefited from them, and they were called the "Eight Virtuous Ones" (Ba Kai). Gaoxin had eight talented sons, whom the world called the "Eight Talented Ones" (Ba Yuan). These sixteen clans, generation after generation, maintained their excellence and did not lose their reputation. When it came to Yao, Yao was unable to promote them. Shun promoted the Eight Virtuous Ones, making them masters of the Ministry of Land (Houtu) to oversee all affairs, and none were out of order. He promoted the Eight Talented Ones, making them spread the five teachings in the four directions: fathers to be righteous, mothers to be compassionate, elder brothers to be friendly, younger brothers to be respectful, and sons to be filial. Thus, there was peace within and order without.

Annals of the Five Emperors:
In former times, Dihong had an untalented son who concealed righteousness and harbored wickedness, delighting in committing evil deeds; the world called him Hundun (Chaos). Shaohao had an untalented son who destroyed trust and hated loyalty, extolling and embellishing evil words; the world called him Qiongqi (Monstrous). Zhuanxu had an untalented son who could not be taught or instructed, and did not understand proper speech; the world called him Taowu (Blockhead). These three clans were a source of worry for generations. When it came to Yao, Yao was unable to remove them. The Jinyun clan had an untalented son who was greedy for food and drink, and rapacious for goods and bribes; the world called him Taotie (Glutton). The world detested him, comparing him to the three wicked ones. Shun, when receiving guests at the four gates, banished these four wicked clans, moving them to the four remote frontiers to ward off evil spirits. Thus, the four gates were opened, meaning there were no wicked people.

Annals of the Five Emperors:
Shun entered the great forests at the foot of the mountains; amidst fierce winds, thunder, and rain, he did not lose his way. Yao then knew that Shun was fit to be entrusted with the empire. Yao, being old, made Shun act as regent, exercising the authority of the Son of Heaven and making tours of inspection. Shun had been promoted and employed in affairs for twenty years when Yao made him regent. He was regent for eight years before Yao died. After the three-year mourning period was completed, he yielded to Danzhu, but the empire turned to Shun. Yu, Gaoyao, Qi, Houji, Boyi, Kui, Long, Chui, Yi, and Pengzu had all been promoted and employed since Yao's time but had not yet been assigned specific duties. Thereupon, Shun went to the temple of the Cultivated Ancestor, consulted with the Four Mountains, opened the four gates, and clearly communicated with the eyes and ears of the four quarters. He ordered the twelve regional chiefs to discuss the Emperor's virtue, to practice profound virtue, and to keep sycophants at a distance; then the barbarian tribes all submitted. Shun said to the Four Mountains, "Is there anyone who can rouse himself to accomplish meritorious deeds for Yao and be appointed to an official position to assist in affairs?" All said, "Bo Yu, as Minister of Works (Sikong), can glorify the Emperor's achievements." Shun said, "Alas, indeed! Yu, you shall pacify the waters and lands; strive diligently in this." Yu bowed his head to the ground and yielded to Ji, Qi, and Gaoyao. Shun said, "Indeed, go forth." Shun said, "Qi, the common people are beginning to suffer from hunger. You, Houji (Lord of Millet), shall sow the hundred grains at the proper times." Shun said, "Qi (Xie), the people are not close to one another, and the five orders of relationships are not harmonious. You shall be Minister of Education (Situ), and respectfully disseminate the five teachings, emphasizing leniency." Shun said, "Gaoyao, the barbarians are troubling the Xia states, and there are bandits, robbers, traitors, and rebels. You shall be Minister of Justice (Shi). The five punishments have their applications; the five applications have three degrees. The five banishments have their proper distances; the five distances have three locations. Only by being discerning can one be trustworthy." Shun said, "Who can manage my artisans?" All said Chui was capable. So he made Chui Minister of Works (Gonggong). Shun said, "Who can manage my grasses, trees, birds, and beasts in the highlands and lowlands?" All said Yi was capable. So he made Yi Imperial Forester (Zhenyu). Yi bowed his head to the ground and yielded to various ministers like Zhu Hu and Xiong Pi. Shun said, "Go forth, you shall harmonize them." He then appointed Zhu Hu and Xiong Pi as his assistants. Shun said, "Alas! Four Mountains, is there anyone who can be in charge of my three rites?" All said Boyi was capable. Shun said, "Alas! Boyi, I appoint you Minister of Rites (Zhizong). Be respectful day and night; be upright and maintain purity and tranquility." Boyi yielded to Kui and Long. Shun said, "Indeed. Appoint Kui as Director of Music (Dianyue) to teach the young. Be upright yet gentle, lenient yet firm, strong but not oppressive, simple but not arrogant. Poetry expresses intent, song prolongs words, sounds follow melodies, and pitches harmonize sounds. The eight kinds of musical instruments should be harmonious and not usurp each other's roles, so that spirits and men may be harmonized." Kui said, "Oh! When I strike the stone chimes and tap the sounding stones, the hundred beasts will all dance." Shun said, "Long, I fear slanderous talk that exterminates truth and alarms my people. I appoint you Minister of Communications (Nayan). Day and night, transmit my orders; be faithful." Shun said, "Alas! You twenty-two men, be respectful! Assist Heaven in its work in a timely manner." Every three years, there was an examination of merits. After three examinations, there were demotions and promotions. The achievements of all, near and far, flourished. He divided and dealt with the San Miao.

Annals of the Five Emperors:
These twenty-two men all accomplished their tasks: Gaoyao served as Chief Justice, and there was peace; the people each submitted and obtained what was rightfully theirs. Boyi presided over rites, and both superiors and inferiors yielded to one another. Chui presided over the artisans, and the hundred crafts achieved success. Yi presided over forestry, and the mountains and marshes were opened up. Qi (Houji) presided over agriculture, and the hundred grains flourished in their seasons. Qi (Xie) presided over education, and the people were harmonious and close. Long presided over guests, and people from distant lands arrived. The twelve regional chiefs carried out their duties, and none in the nine provinces dared to disobey or deviate. Only Yu's achievements were the greatest: he cut through nine mountains, opened up nine marshes, dredged nine rivers, and defined the nine provinces. Each came with tribute according to its products, not failing in what was appropriate. For five thousand li, it extended to the uncultivated regions. To the south, he pacified Jiaozhi and Beifa. To the west, the Xirong, Xizhi, Qusou, Di, and Qiang. To the north, the Shanrong, Fa, and Xishen. To the east, the Chang and Niaoyi. Within the four seas, all revered the achievements of Emperor Shun. Thereupon, Yu initiated the music of Jiuzhao, which attracted extraordinary creatures, and phoenixes came to soar. All the manifest virtues in the world began with Emperor Yu (Shun).

Annals of the Five Emperors:
Shun was known for his filial piety at the age of twenty. At thirty, Yao promoted him. At fifty, he acted as regent, performing the duties of the Son of Heaven. At fifty-eight, Yao died. At sixty-one, he succeeded Yao and ascended the imperial throne. He was on the imperial throne for thirty-nine years. He made a southern tour of inspection and died in the wilderness of Cangwu. He was buried south of the Yangtze River at Jiuyi, which is Lingling. When Shun ascended the imperial throne, he carried the banner of the Son of Heaven and went to pay homage to his father Gusou, behaving with utmost reverence and propriety, as a son should. He enfeoffed his younger brother Xiang as a feudal lord. Shun's son Shangjun was also unworthy, so Shun recommended Yu to Heaven in advance. Seventeen years later, he died. After the three-year mourning period was completed, Yu also yielded to Shun's son, just as Shun had yielded to Yao's son. The feudal lords turned to him, and then Yu ascended the throne of the Son of Heaven. Yao's son Danzhu and Shun's son Shangjun both had territories to maintain the ancestral sacrifices. They wore their proper attire and performed rites and music accordingly. They were received by the Son of Heaven as guests, and the Son of Heaven did not treat them as subjects, showing that he did not dare to act exclusively.

Annals of the Five Emperors:
From the Yellow Emperor to Shun and Yu, all had the same surname but different state names, in order to manifest their illustrious virtue. Thus, the Yellow Emperor was Youxiong, Emperor Zhuanxu was Gaoyang, Emperor Ku was Gaoxin, Emperor Yao was Taotang, and Emperor Shun was Youyu. Emperor Yu was Xiahou and had a different clan name, surnamed Si. Qi was Shang, surnamed Zi. Qi (棄) was Zhou, surnamed Ji.

Annals of the Five Emperors:
The Grand Historian says: Scholars often speak of the Five Emperors, which is ancient indeed. However, the Book of Documents only records events from Yao onwards. The Hundred Schools of thought speak of the Yellow Emperor, but their writings are not elegant or standard, and gentlemen scholars find it difficult to speak of them. Confucius transmitted Zai Yu's questions about the virtues of the Five Emperors and their lineage and surnames, but some Confucians do not transmit this. I have traveled west to Kongtong, north past Zhuolu, east to the sea, and south, floating on the Yangtze and Huai rivers. Wherever I went, elders often spoke of the places associated with the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun. Their customs and teachings were certainly different, but in general, those accounts that do not deviate from the ancient texts are close to the truth. I have examined the Spring and Autumn Annals and the Discourses of the States, and their elucidation of the virtues of the Five Emperors and their lineage and surnames is clear. However, scholars have not deeply investigated them, and what they reveal is not baseless. The Book of Documents has gaps and omissions, but scattered accounts occasionally appear in other texts. Without diligent study and deep thought, to understand their meaning with one's heart, it is indeed difficult to explain to those with shallow knowledge and limited experience. I have compiled and arranged these accounts, selecting those with particularly elegant language, and thus written them as the beginning of the Basic Annals.
