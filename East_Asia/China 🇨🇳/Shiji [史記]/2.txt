Annals of the Xia Dynasty:
Xia Yu, whose personal name was Wenming. Yu's father was Gun, Gun's father was Emperor Zhuanxu, Zhuanxu's father was Changyi, and Changyi's father was the Yellow Emperor. Yu was the great-great-grandson of the Yellow Emperor and the grandson of Emperor Zhuanxu. Yu's great-grandfather Changyi and his father Gun both did not attain the imperial throne, serving as ministers.

2
During the time of Emperor Yao, a great flood raged, vast waters enveloped the mountains and submerged the hills, and the common people were distressed. Yao sought someone capable of controlling the waters. The assembled ministers and the Four Chiefs all said Gun was capable. Yao said: "Gun is a man who disobeys orders and harms his kin; he is not suitable." The Four Chiefs said: "Among those of his rank, there is none more capable than Gun. We wish Your Majesty to try him." Thereupon, Yao listened to the Four Chiefs and employed Gun to control the waters. For nine years, the waters did not subside, and his efforts were unsuccessful. Then Emperor Yao sought another person and found Shun. Shun was promoted and employed, acting as regent in the Son of Heaven's administration, and went on inspection tours. On inspecting Gun's water control efforts and finding them ineffective, he had Gun executed at Mount Yu. All under Heaven considered Shun's execution [of Gun] to be just. Thereupon, Shun promoted Gun's son, Yu, and had him continue Gun's work.

3
After Yao passed away, Emperor Shun asked the Four Chiefs: "Is there anyone who can successfully complete Yao's great undertakings and be appointed to office?" They all said: "Bo Yu, as Minister of Works (Sikong), can complete Yao's great achievements." Shun said: "Ah, yes!" He commanded Yu: "You are to pacify the waters and the land. Strive diligently in this." Yu bowed his head to the ground and deferred to Qi, Houji, and Gaoyao. Shun said: "You go and attend to your duties."

4
Yu was a man who was quick-witted, capable, and diligent; his virtue was without fault, his benevolence approachable, his words trustworthy; his voice was a musical standard, his body a measure, and he was known accordingly; assiduous and reverent, he was a model of conduct and order.

5
Yu then, along with Yi and Houji, received the Emperor's command, ordering the feudal lords and common people to raise laborers to distribute earth, travel the mountains marking trees, and define the high mountains and great rivers. Yu, grieving that his late father Gun's work was unfinished and had led to his execution, toiled physically and anxtiously, living away from home for thirteen years, passing his own door but not daring to enter. He wore simple clothes and ate frugally, offering utmost filial piety to the spirits and deities. He lived in a humble dwelling, dedicating resources to ditches and canals. Traveling on land, he used a cart; on water, a boat; in mud, a sled; in the mountains, a spiked litter. With a leveling line in his left hand and a compass and square in his right, carrying [instruments for] the four seasons, he opened up the Nine Provinces, connected the Nine Roads, dammed the Nine Marshes, and surveyed the Nine Mountains. He ordered Yi to give the common people rice, which could be planted in low-lying, damp areas. He ordered Houji to give the common people food that was difficult to obtain. When food was scarce, he adjusted surpluses to supply deficiencies, thereby equalizing [resources among] the feudal lords. Yu then traveled, observing what was suitable for each region to offer as tribute, and the conveniences of its mountains and rivers.

6
Yu's work began with Jizhou. Jizhou: Having dealt with Hukou, he managed Liang and Qi. Having improved Taiyuan, he reached Yueyang. His efforts at Tanhuai were successful, reaching Hengzhang.

The Six Treasuries were well-managed, all lands were properly administered, finances and tributes were handled with great care, and all followed the three grades of soil for levying tribute.

19
To the east, it reached the sea; to the west, it extended to the shifting sands; to the north and south it also reached: his fame and teachings spread throughout the Four Seas. Thereupon, the Emperor bestowed upon Yu a dark jade tablet, to announce his success to all under Heaven. All under Heaven was then at peace and well-ordered.

20
Gaoyao was appointed Minister of Justice (Shi) to govern the people. At Emperor Shun's court, Yu, Bo Yi, and Gaoyao conversed before the Emperor. Gaoyao set forth his counsel, saying: "Be sincere in one's virtue, plan wisely, and assist harmoniously." Yu said: "Indeed, but how?" Gaoyao said: "Oh! Be careful in self-cultivation, think long-term, maintain harmony among the nine degrees of kinship, let the many talented assist and support, and those near will be models for those far." Yu bowed to the excellent words, saying: "Indeed." Gaoyao said: "Oh! It lies in knowing men and pacifying the people." Yu said: "Alas! If all were so, even the Emperor would find it difficult. To know men is wisdom, enabling one to appoint them to office; to pacify the people is benevolence, and the common folk will cherish you. If one can be wise and benevolent, what worry is there of Huandou, why banish the You Miao, what fear is there of flatterers with clever words and pleasing countenances?" Gaoyao said: "Indeed, oh! There are also nine virtues in conduct, and one should speak of having virtue." Then he said: "In handling affairs: be generous yet firm, gentle yet established, sincere yet respectful, orderly yet reverent, compliant yet resolute, straightforward yet mild, simple yet incorruptible, strong yet substantial, unyielding yet righteous. Manifest these consistently, and it will be auspicious. Daily promote three of these virtues, morning and night, to enlighten and assist in managing a household. Daily strictly uphold and respectfully practice six of these virtues to brightly govern a state. Comprehensively embrace and universally apply them; when all nine virtues are practiced, talented and worthy men will be in office, and all officials will be solemn and careful. Do not teach depraved, licentious, or strange schemes. For the wrong person to occupy an office is called disrupting Heaven's affairs. Heaven punishes the guilty; the five punishments are to be applied accordingly. Can my words be put into practice?" Yu said: "Your words can indeed lead to achievements if practiced." Gaoyao said: "I do not yet possess full knowledge; I think only of assisting the Way."

21
Emperor Shun said to Yu: "You too speak eloquently." Yu bowed and said: "Oh, what can I say! I think daily with diligence." Gaoyao questioned Yu, saying: "What do you mean by 'diligence'?" Yu said: "The great flood raged, vast waters enveloped the mountains and submerged the hills, and the common people were all subdued by the waters. I traveled on land by cart, on water by boat, in mud by sled, in mountains by spiked shoes, traversing mountains and felling timber. With Yi, I gave the common people rice and fresh food. I dredged the Nine Rivers to lead to the Four Seas, deepened the ditches and canals to lead to the rivers. With Ji, I gave the common people food that was hard to obtain. When food was scarce, I adjusted surpluses to make up for deficiencies and relocated people. Only then were the common people settled, and the myriad states brought to order." Gaoyao said: "Indeed, this is your excellence."

22
Yu said: "Oh, Emperor! Be cautious in your position, be content in your station. Assist virtue, and all under Heaven will respond greatly. With a pure mind, respectfully await the High God's mandate; Heaven will then renew its mandate with blessings." The Emperor said: "Alas, ministers, ministers! Ministers are my limbs, ears, and eyes. I wish to guide the people, and you assist me. I wish to observe the symbols of the ancients. The sun, moon, and stars are for embroidered robes and colors; you clarify them. I wish to hear the six pitch-pipes, five tones, and eight sounds, to correct what is aberrant and to regulate the five types of speech; you listen for me. If I err, you correct and assist me. Do not flatter me to my face and slander me behind my back. Respect the four auxiliary ministers. If all the slanderous and favored petty officials are removed, the ruler's virtue, sincerely applied, will purify all." Yu said: "Indeed. If the Emperor is not timely and treats good and evil alike, there will be no achievements."

23
The Emperor said: "Do not be like Danzhu, who was arrogant, loved only indolent pleasures, [improperly] sailed boats on land, and engaged in debauchery with his companions at home, thereby bringing his lineage to an end. I cannot condone this." Yu said: "I married [a woman from] Tushan on the Xinyou and Renxu days; on the Guichou and Jiayin days, Qi was born, but I did not treat him as a son, and because of this I was able to complete the work on the waters and land. I helped establish the five domains, extending to five thousand li, with twelve masters for the provinces. Beyond, reaching to the Four Seas, five chiefs were established in each, and all performed meritoriously. The Miao were stubborn and did not submit to our achievements; may the Emperor consider this." The Emperor said: "Guiding by my virtue, it is your achievements that have put things in order."

24
Gaoyao thereupon respected Yu's virtue and ordered the people to all model themselves on Yu. Those who did not follow his words were punished. Shun's virtue shone greatly.

25
Thereupon Kui performed music, the ancestral spirits arrived, the feudal lords yielded to one another, birds and beasts soared and danced. When the Xiaoshao music was performed nine times, phoenixes came to pay homage, all beasts danced, and all officials were truly harmonious. The Emperor, inspired by this, made a song, saying: "To ascend to Heaven's mandate, it is timely, it is subtle." Then he sang: "Joyful are the limbs, roused is the head, flourishing are all the works!" Gaoyao bowed his hands and head to the ground, and proclaimed: "Be mindful! Lead in undertaking affairs, be careful with your laws, be reverent!" Then he changed his song, saying: "Enlightened is the head, excellent are the limbs, prosperous are all affairs!" (Shun) sang again: "If the head is muddled, if the limbs are lazy, all affairs will fail!" The Emperor bowed and said: "Indeed! Go forth and be respectful!" Thereupon, all under Heaven revered Yu's understanding of measures, numbers, sounds, and music, and made him lord of the spirits of mountains and rivers.

26
Emperor Shun recommended Yu to Heaven as his successor. Seventeen years later, Emperor Shun passed away. After the three-year mourning period was completed, Yu declined the throne and withdrew to Yangcheng in favor of Shun's son, Shangjun. All the feudal lords under Heaven left Shangjun and paid homage to Yu. Yu thereupon ascended the throne of the Son of Heaven, faced south to receive homage from all under Heaven, and the dynastic title was Xiahou, with the surname Si.

27
Emperor Yu, having ascended the throne, promoted Gaoyao and recommended him [as successor], intending to entrust him with the government, but Gaoyao died. He enfeoffed Gaoyao's descendants in Ying and Liu, and some in Xu. Afterwards, he promoted Yi and entrusted him with the government.

28
After ten years, Emperor Yu went on an inspection tour to the east, reached Kuaiji, and passed away. He entrusted the empire to Yi. After the three-year mourning period was completed, Yi yielded to Emperor Yu's son, Qi, and withdrew to live on the south side of Mount Ji. Yu's son Qi was worthy, and the hearts of all under Heaven turned to him. When Yu passed away, although he had entrusted [the empire] to Yi, Yi's assistance to Yu had been for a short time, and all under Heaven were not yet attached to him. Therefore, all the feudal lords left Yi and paid homage to Qi, saying: "He is the son of our lord, Emperor Yu." Thereupon, Qi ascended the throne of the Son of Heaven; this was Emperor Qi of Xiahou.

29
Emperor Qi of Xiahou was Yu's son; his mother was the daughter of the Tushan clan.

30
The You Hu clan did not submit. Qi attacked them, and a great battle took place at Gan. Before the battle, he composed the "Oath at Gan" and summoned the six high ministers to proclaim it. Qi said: "Ah! Men of the six offices, I swear and announce to you: The You Hu clan has defied and insulted the Five Elements, neglected and abandoned the Three Standards. Heaven thereby intends to cut off its mandate. Now, I respectfully carry out Heaven's punishment. If the left [of the chariot] does not attack on the left, and the right does not attack on the right, you are not obeying orders. If the charioteer does not manage his horses correctly, you are not obeying orders. Those who obey orders will be rewarded before the ancestral shrine; those who disobey orders will be executed before the altar of the land, and I will then enslave your wives and children." He then exterminated the You Hu clan. All under Heaven paid homage.

31
Emperor Qi of Xiahou passed away, and his son Emperor Tai Kang was enthroned. Emperor Tai Kang lost the kingdom. His five younger brothers waited by the Luo riverbank and composed the "Song of the Five Sons."

32
Tai Kang passed away, and his younger brother Zhong Kang was enthroned; this was Emperor Zhong Kang. During Emperor Zhong Kang's time, Xi and He were addicted to drink and debauchery, neglecting their duties regarding the seasons and confusing the calendar. Yin went to campaign against them and composed the "Punitive Expedition of Yin."

33
Zhong Kang passed away, his son Emperor Xiang was enthroned. Emperor Xiang passed away, his son Emperor Shao Kang was enthroned. Emperor Shao Kang passed away, his son Emperor Yu was enthroned. Emperor Yu passed away, his son Emperor Huai was enthroned. Emperor Huai passed away, his son Emperor Mang was enthroned. Emperor Mang passed away, his son Emperor Xie was enthroned. Emperor Xie passed away, his son Emperor Bu Jiang was enthroned. Emperor Bu Jiang passed away, his younger brother Emperor Jiong was enthroned. Emperor Jiong passed away, his son Emperor Jin was enthroned. Emperor Jin passed away, and Kong Jia, son of Emperor Bu Jiang, was enthroned; this was Emperor Kong Jia. Emperor Kong Jia, once enthroned, was fond of occult arts and spirits, and engaged in licentious and disorderly conduct. The virtue of the Xiahou clan declined, and the feudal lords rebelled against it. Heaven sent down two dragons, a male and a female. Kong Jia could not feed them, as he had not yet found a Dragon Tamer. The Taotang clan having declined, one of their descendants was Liu Lei, who learned to domesticate dragons from the Huanlong clan and served Kong Jia. Kong Jia bestowed upon him the surname Yulong (Dragon Controller) and made him successor to the Shiwei [clan's fief]. One of the female dragons died, and [Liu Lei] served it as food to the Xiahou [ruler, Kong Jia]. The Xiahou [ruler] sent for more, and [Liu Lei], fearing [punishment], fled.

34
Kong Jia passed away, his son Emperor Gao was enthroned. Emperor Gao passed away, his son Emperor Fa was enthroned. Emperor Fa passed away, his son Emperor Lü Gui was enthroned; this was Jie. During the time of Emperor Jie, since Kong Jia, many feudal lords had rebelled against Xia. Jie did not cultivate virtue but oppressed the people with military force, and the people could not bear it. He summoned Tang and imprisoned him at Xiatai, but later released him. Tang cultivated his virtue, and all the feudal lords turned to Tang. Tang then led troops to attack Jie of Xia. Jie fled to Mingtiao, was subsequently exiled, and died. Jie said to someone: "I regret not having killed Tang at Xiatai, allowing things to come to this." Tang then ascended the throne of the Son of Heaven and, replacing Xia, ruled all under Heaven. Tang enfeoffed the descendants of Xia; later, during the Zhou dynasty, they were enfeoffed in Qi.

35
The Grand Historian says: Yu's surname was Si. His descendants were enfeoffed in various states, and they adopted their state names as surnames. Thus, there were the Xiahou clan, You Hu clan, Younan clan, Zhenxun clan, Tongcheng clan, Bao clan, Fei clan, Qi clan, Zeng clan, Xin clan, Ming clan, and Zhengge clan. Confucius corrected the Xia calendar, and scholars mostly transmit the "Xia Xiao Zheng" (Lesser Annuary of Xia). From the time of Yu [Shun] and Xia, the system of tribute and taxes was already complete. Some say Yu assembled the feudal lords south of the Jiang (Yangtze River), reckoned their merits, and passed away. He was buried there, and the place was named Kuaiji. Kuaiji means "Assembly and Accounting."
