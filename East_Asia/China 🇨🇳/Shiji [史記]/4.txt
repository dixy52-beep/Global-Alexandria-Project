Annals of Zhou:

Hou Ji of Zhou, personal name Qi. His mother was a woman of the You Tai clan, named Jiang Yuan. Jiang Yuan was the principal consort of Emperor Ku. Jiang Yuan went out to the fields and saw a giant's footprint. Her heart was joyful and pleased, and she desired to step on it. Upon stepping on it, her body moved as if she were pregnant. After the full term, she gave birth to a son. Believing him to be inauspicious, she abandoned him in a narrow alley; horses and oxen passing by all avoided treading on him. She moved him and placed him in a forest, but it happened that there were many people in the mountain forest, so they moved him again. Then she abandoned him on the ice in a channel, and flying birds covered and protected him with their wings. Jiang Yuan believed him to be divine, so she took him back and raised him. Because she initially wanted to abandon him, she named him Qi.

When Qi was a child, he had the aspirations of a giant. In his play, he enjoyed planting hemp and beans, and the hemp and beans grew beautifully. When he became an adult, he developed a fondness for farming, observing the suitability of the land, and cultivating grains where they were appropriate. The people all followed his example. Emperor Yao heard of him and appointed Qi as Minister of Agriculture. The world benefited from him, and he had merit. Emperor Shun said: "Qi, the common people were beginning to starve, and you, as Hou Ji (Lord Millet), sowed the various grains at the right time." He enfeoffed Qi at Tai, with the title Hou Ji, and gave him the separate surname Ji. The rise of Hou Ji occurred during the time of Tao Tang (Yao), Yu (Shun), and Xia, and he always possessed excellent virtue.

When Hou Ji died, his son Buzhu was established. In Buzhu's later years, the government of the Xiahou clan declined. They abandoned the duties of the Minister of Agriculture, and Buzhu, having lost his office, fled among the Rong and Di tribes. Buzhu died, and his son Ju was established. Ju died, and his son Gong Liu was established. Although Gong Liu was among the Rong and Di, he revived the undertakings of Hou Ji. He devoted himself to cultivation, assessed the suitability of the land, crossed the Wei River from the Qi and Ju rivers, gathered materials for use. Travelers had provisions, and settlers had stores and savings. The people relied on his benevolence. The common people cherished him, and many migrated to seek his protection and allegiance. The rise of the Way of Zhou began from this. Therefore, poets sang in praise of his virtue. Gong Liu died, and his son Qingjie was established, founding his state at Bin.

Qingjie died, and his son Huangpu was established. Huangpu died, and his son Chaifu was established. Chaifu died, and his son Huiyu was established. Huiyu died, and his son Gongfei was established. Gongfei died, and his son Gaoyu was established. Gaoyu died, and his son Yayu was established. Yayu died, and his son Gongshu Zulei was established. Gongshu Zulei died, and his son Gugong Danfu was established. Gugong Danfu revived the undertakings of Hou Ji and Gong Liu, accumulated virtue and practiced righteousness, and the people of the state all supported him. The Xunyu Rong and Di attacked him, wanting to obtain wealth and goods, and he gave it to them. They attacked again, wanting to obtain land and people. The people were all angry and wanted to fight. Gugong said: "People establish a ruler to benefit them. Now the Rong and Di attack because of my land and people. Whether the people are with me or with them, what is the difference? If the people want to fight because of me, killing fathers and sons so that I may be their ruler, I cannot bear to do it." So he, along with his personal attendants, left Bin, crossed the Qi and Ju rivers, went over Mount Liang, and stopped at the foot of Mount Qi. The people of Bin, supporting the old and carrying the young, all returned to Gugong at the foot of Mount Qi. When other neighboring states heard of Gugong's benevolence, many also came to him. Thereupon, Gugong reformed the customs of the Rong and Di, built city walls, houses, and residences, and organized them into distinct settlements. He established the five official posts with their respective duties. The people all sang and rejoiced, praising his virtue.

Gugong had an eldest son named Taibo, and a second son named Yuzhong. Tai Jiang gave birth to a younger son, Jili. Jili married Tairen. Both were virtuous women. She gave birth to Chang, who showed signs of sagehood. Gugong said: "My lineage is destined to have someone who will rise. Will it be Chang?" The eldest son Taibo and Yuzhong knew that Gugong wished to establish Jili to pass the succession to Chang. So the two of them fled to Jing Man, tattooed their bodies, and cut their hair, to yield to Jili.

Gugong died, and Jili was established. This was Gongji. Gongji cultivated the legacy of Gugong, was devoted to practicing righteousness, and the feudal lords submitted to him.

Gongji died, and his son Chang was established. This was Xibo (Westernä¼¯). Xibo, known as King Wen, followed the undertakings of Hou Ji and Gong Liu, modeled himself on the laws of Gugong and Gongji, was deeply benevolent, respected the old, and was kind to the young. He treated worthy men with courtesy, often not having time to eat at midday in order to receive scholars, and because of this, many scholars came to him. Boyi and Shuqi, in Guzhu, heard that Xibo was good at caring for the elderly, and thought, "Why not go and submit to him?" Taidian, Hong Yao, San Yisheng, Yuzi, and Grand Master Xin Jia, among others, all went and submitted to him.

Marquis Hu of Chong slandered Xibo to King Zhou of Yin, saying: "Xibo accumulates goodness and amasses virtue. All the feudal lords incline towards him. This will be disadvantageous to the Emperor." Emperor Zhou then imprisoned Xibo at Youli. Hong Yao and his associates were worried about this. So they sought a beautiful woman from the Youxin clan, patterned horses from the Li Rong, nine teams of four horses from Youxiong, and other rare and strange items. Through Fei Zhong, a favored minister of Yin, they presented these to Zhou. Zhou was greatly pleased and said: "One of these items alone is enough to release Xibo, how much more so with so many!" So he pardoned Xibo, bestowed upon him bows, arrows, axes, and battle-axes, and authorized Xibo to conduct punitive expeditions. He said: "The one who slandered Xibo was Marquis Hu of Chong." Xibo then presented the land west of the Luo River to request that Zhou abolish the punishment of "Paoge" (burning pillar). Zhou granted his request.

Xibo secretly practiced goodness, and all the feudal lords came to him for just settlements. At that time, the people of Yu and Rui had a dispute they could not resolve, so they went to Zhou. Upon entering its borders, they saw that farmers all yielded the boundaries of their fields, and the local customs were for everyone to yield to their elders. The people of Yu and Rui, before even seeing Xibo, were all ashamed and said to each other: "What we are fighting over is what the people of Zhou consider shameful. Why go on? We will only bring disgrace upon ourselves." So they turned back, both yielding and departing. When the feudal lords heard of this, they said, "Xibo must be the ruler who has received the Mandate of Heaven."

The following year, he attacked the Quanrong. The year after, he attacked Mixu. The year after that, he defeated the state of Qi. Zu Yi of Yin heard of this, was frightened, and reported it to Emperor Zhou. Zhou said: "Is there not the Mandate of Heaven? What can he do!" The following year, he attacked Yu. The year after, he attacked Marquis Hu of Chong. And he built the city of Feng, moving the capital from the foot of Mount Qi to Feng. The following year, Xibo died, and Crown Prince Fa was established. This was King Wu.

Xibo had been on the throne for fifty years. During his imprisonment at Youli, he supposedly expanded the eight trigrams of the Yijing into sixty-four hexagrams. Poets speak of Xibo, saying that in the year he received the Mandate, he was called King and settled the dispute of Yu and Rui. Ten years later, he died and was posthumously named King Wen. He reformed the laws and regulations, and established the calendar. He posthumously honored Gugong as King Tai, and Gongji as King Ji: for the signs of kingship had indeed begun with King Tai.

King Wu ascended the throne, with Taigong Wang as his strategist (Shi), Zhou Gong Dan as his assistant (Fu), and Zhao Gong, Bi Gong, and others supporting the King on his left and right, to continue and expand King Wen's undertakings.

In the ninth year, King Wu performed sacrifices at Bi. He reviewed his troops in the east, reaching Mengjin. He had a wooden spirit tablet made for King Wen, carried it in a chariot in the midst of the army. King Wu referred to himself as Crown Prince Fa, stating that he was acting on behalf of King Wen in the campaign and did not dare to act on his own authority. He then announced to the Sima (Minister of War), Situ (Minister of Education), Sikong (Minister of Works), and various officials: "Be disciplined and sincere! I am without knowledge, but with virtuous ministers from my ancestors, I, a mere youth, have received the merits of my predecessors. I will thoroughly establish rewards and punishments to affirm their achievements." He then raised his army. Shi Shangfu (Taigong Wang) proclaimed: "Gather all your multitudes, with your boats and oars; those who arrive late will be beheaded." King Wu crossed the Yellow River. In midstream, a white fish leaped into the King's boat. King Wu bent down, took it, and offered it as a sacrifice. After crossing, fire descended from above and returned below, reaching the King's tent, and transformed into a crow, red in color, its call was "po yun." At this time, eight hundred feudal lords assembled at Mengjin without prior arrangement. The lords all said: "Zhou can be attacked!" King Wu said: "You do not yet know the Mandate of Heaven; it is not yet possible." So he withdrew his army and returned.

Two years later, he heard that Zhou's depravity, chaos, and tyranny had intensified. He had killed Prince Bigan and imprisoned Jizi. Grand Master Ci and Junior Master Qiang fled to Zhou, carrying their musical instruments. Thereupon, King Wu announced to all the feudal lords: "Yin has committed grave crimes; we cannot but completely overthrow him." Following King Wen's precedent, he led three hundred war chariots, three thousand "Tiger Braves" (elite guards), and forty-five thousand armored soldiers to attack Zhou in the east. In the eleventh year, on the wuwu day of the twelfth month, the army completely crossed Mengjin. The feudal lords all assembled. They said: "Be diligent and do not slacken!" King Wu then made the "Great Oath," proclaiming to the multitudes: "Now, King Zhou of Yin uses the words of his woman, has cut himself off from Heaven, destroyed the three rectitudes, alienated his royal uncles and brothers, abandoned the music of his ancestors, and composed licentious sounds, using them to confuse and disrupt proper music, to please women. Therefore, I, Fa, am now respectfully carrying out Heaven's punishment. Strive on, my officers! There will be no second chance, no third chance!"

On the jiazi day of the second month, at dawn, King Wu advanced to Muye in the suburbs of Shang, and then made an oath. King Wu held a yellow battle-axe in his left hand and a white yak-tail banner in his right, using it to command. He said: "Men of the western lands, you have come far!" King Wu said: "Ah! My lords of allied states, Minister of Education, Minister of War, Minister of Works, Assistant Commanders, Commanders of a thousand, Commanders of a hundred, and you men of Yong, Shu, Qiang, Mao, Wei, Lu, Peng, and Pu, raise your halberds, align your shields, and ready your spears. I shall make an oath." The King said: "The ancients had a saying, 'A hen does not crow at dawn. If a hen crows at dawn, the house is ruined.' Now, King Zhou of Yin only listens to the words of women, has abandoned the sacrifices to his ancestors and does not respond, has neglected and forsaken his state and family, and does not employ his royal uncles and brothers. Instead, he esteems, promotes, trusts, and employs numerous criminals and fugitives from all quarters, allowing them to tyrannize the people and commit treachery in the state of Shang. Now I, Fa, am respectfully carrying out Heaven's punishment. In today's battle, advance no more than six or seven steps, then halt and align. Strive on, my officers! Charge no more than four, five, six, or seven times, then halt and align. Strive on, my officers! Be valiant, like tigers, like brown bears, like jackals, like panthers, in the suburbs of Shang. Do not stop those who flee to surrender, so they may serve the western lands. Strive on, my officers! If you do not strive, you yourselves will face execution." After the oath, the assembled forces of the feudal lords numbered four thousand chariots. They arrayed their troops at Muye.

Emperor Zhou heard that King Wu was coming and also dispatched an army of seven hundred thousand men to resist King Wu. King Wu sent Shi Shangfu with a hundred officers to challenge Zhou's army, and then charged at Emperor Zhou's forces with his main contingent. Although Zhou's army was numerous, they all had no will to fight; their hearts wished for King Wu to enter quickly. Zhou's soldiers all turned their weapons around to fight, to open a path for King Wu. King Wu charged, and Zhou's troops all collapsed and turned against Zhou. Zhou fled, returned, and ascended the Deer Terrace. He covered himself with his precious jades and burned himself to death in the fire. King Wu, holding a large white banner, signaled to the feudal lords. The feudal lords all bowed to King Wu. King Wu then saluted the feudal lords, and the feudal lords all followed him. King Wu reached the state of Shang, and the common people of Shang all waited for him in the suburbs. Thereupon, King Wu sent his ministers to inform the people of Shang: "Heaven has sent down blessings!" The people of Shang all kowtowed twice. King Wu also returned the bow. He then entered and reached the place where Zhou had died. King Wu himself shot at him three times, then dismounted from his chariot, struck him with a light sword, and cut off Zhou's head with a yellow battle-axe, hanging it on a large white banner. Afterwards, he went to Zhou's two favored concubines; both women had hanged themselves. King Wu shot at them three times again, struck them with a sword, cut off their heads with a black battle-axe, and hung their heads on a small white banner. King Wu then departed and returned to his army.

The next day, they cleared the roads and repaired the altars of the land and the palace of Shang Zhou. When the time came, a hundred men carrying ceremonial flags led the way. King Wu's younger brother, Shu Zhenduo, presented the ceremonial chariots. Zhou Gong Dan held a large battle-axe, and Bi Gong held a small battle-axe, flanking King Wu. San Yisheng, Taidian, and Hong Yao all held swords to guard King Wu. After entering, they stood to the left of the main contingent south of the altar of the land, with [left and] right attendants all following. Mao Shu Zheng offered pure water, Wei Kangshu Feng spread mats, Zhao Gong Shi assisted with the offerings, and Shi Shangfu led the sacrificial animal. Yin Yi, holding bamboo slips, read the prayer: "The last descendant of Yin, Ji Zhou, has extinguished and abandoned the bright virtue of former kings, insulted and neglected the gods and spirits by not sacrificing, and tyrannized the people of the Shang capital. His deeds are manifest and known to the Supreme Emperor of Heaven." Thereupon, King Wu kowtowed twice, saying: "I have received the great mandate, to reform Yin and receive Heaven's bright command." King Wu kowtowed twice again, then departed.

He enfeoffed LÃ¼fu, son of King Zhou of Shang, with the remaining people of Yin. As Yin was newly pacified and not yet settled, King Wu ordered his younger brothers Guan Shu Xian and Cai Shu Du to assist LÃ¼fu in governing Yin. Afterwards, he ordered Zhao Gong to release Jizi from prison. He ordered Bi Gong to release the common people from prison and to honor the village gate of Shang Rong. He ordered Nangong Kuo to distribute the wealth of the Deer Terrace and the grain of the Juqiao granary to relieve the poor, weak, and enslaved. He ordered Nangong Kuo and Shi Yi to display the Nine Tripods and precious jades. He ordered Hong Yao to build a tomb for Bigan. He ordered the Zongzhu (Master of Rites) to offer sacrifices in the army. Then he disbanded his troops and returned west. He went on a hunting tour, recorded governmental affairs, and composed the "Wucheng" (Completion of the Martial Enterprise). He enfeoffed the feudal lords, distributed sacrificial vessels, and composed the "Distribution of Yin's Artifacts." King Wu, reflecting on the sage kings of the past, enfeoffed a descendant of Shennong at Jiao, a descendant of the Yellow Emperor at Zhu, a descendant of Emperor Yao at Ji, a descendant of Emperor Shun at Chen, and a descendant of Great Yu at Qi. Then he enfeoffed meritorious ministers and strategists, with Shi Shangfu being the first to be enfeoffed. He enfeoffed Shangfu at Yingqiu, named Qi. He enfeoffed his younger brother Zhou Gong Dan at Qufu, named Lu. He enfeoffed Zhao Gong Shi at Yan. He enfeoffed his younger brother Shu Xian at Guan, and his younger brother Shu Du at Cai. The rest received enfeoffments according to their rank.

King Wu summoned the rulers of the nine provinces, ascended the mound of Bin, and looked towards the city of Shang. King Wu arrived at Zhou, and could not sleep through the night. Zhou Gong Dan went to the King's place and asked: "Why can you not sleep?" The King said: "Let me tell you: Heaven does not favor Yin. From before I, Fa, was born until now, sixty years have passed; deer roam in the pastures, and wild geese fill the fields. Heaven did not favor Yin, and now it is accomplished. Heaven established Yin, and its registered people numbered three hundred and sixty men. They were neither prominent nor subjugated, and so it has been until today. I have not yet secured Heaven's protection; how can I have leisure to sleep!" The King said: "To secure Heaven's protection, to rely on Heaven's house, to seek out all the evil ones, and to depose those who followed the King of Yin. Day and night I have toiled to pacify my western lands. My rule is manifest, and my virtue is bright. From the confluence of the Luo River to the confluence of the Yi River, the dwelling is easy and not precarious; it is where the Xia dynasty resided. I look south to the Three Tu mountains, north to the Yue border, look back at the Yellow River, and gaze at the Luo and Yi rivers. Do not be far from Heaven's house." He planned for Zhou to reside in Luoyi and then departed. He released the horses on the southern slopes of Mount Hua and let the oxen graze in the wilderness of Taolin. He laid down shields and spears, demobilized the troops, and disbanded the army, showing the world that they would not be used again.

Two years after King Wu had conquered Yin, he asked Jizi why Yin had perished. Jizi could not bear to speak of Yin's evils, but told him about the principles for the survival and fall of a state. King Wu was also ashamed, so he asked about the Way of Heaven.

King Wu fell ill. The realm was not yet settled, and the dukes were afraid. They performed divination by turtle shell. Zhou Gong then purified himself through fasting, offered himself as a substitute, wishing to take King Wu's place. King Wu recovered. Later, he died, and Crown Prince Song succeeded him. This was King Cheng.

King Cheng was young. Zhou had just pacified the realm, and Zhou Gong feared that the feudal lords would rebel against Zhou. So, the Duke administered the government as regent. Guan Shu, Cai Shu, and other younger brothers suspected Zhou Gong and, together with Wu Geng, started a rebellion against Zhou. Zhou Gong, by order of King Cheng, attacked and executed Wu Geng and Guan Shu, and banished Cai Shu. He made Weizi Kai the successor to Yin, with his state at Song. He gathered many of the remaining people of Yin and enfeoffed King Wu's younger brother Feng as Kangshu of Wei. Shu Yu of Tang in Jin obtained fine grain and presented it to King Cheng. King Cheng gave it to Zhou Gong at the military camp. Zhou Gong received the grain in the eastern lands, by the Son of Heaven's command to Lu. Initially, when Guan and Cai rebelled against Zhou, Zhou Gong campaigned against them and completely pacified them in three years. Therefore, he first composed the "Great Announcement," then the "Charge to Weizi," then "Return of the Grain," then "Excellent Grain," then "Announcement to Kang," "Announcement about Wine," and "Timber for Coffins." These matters are recorded in the chapters about Zhou Gong. Zhou Gong administered the government for seven years. When King Cheng came of age, Zhou Gong returned the government to King Cheng and took his place among the ministers, facing north.

King Cheng was in Feng. He ordered Zhao Gong to renew the construction of Luoyi, according to King Wu's intention. Zhou Gong again performed divination and inspected the site. They finally completed the construction and placed the Nine Tripods there. He said: "This is the center of the world; the distances for tribute from all four directions are equal." He composed the "Announcement of Zhao" and the "Announcement of Luo." After King Cheng had relocated the remaining people of Yin, Zhou Gong, by the King's command, informed them, composing "Many Officers" and "No Idleness." Zhao Gong served as Protector (Bao), and Zhou Gong served as Grand Tutor (Shi). He launched an eastern expedition against the Huaiyi, destroyed Yan, and relocated its ruler, Bo Beng. King Cheng returned from Yan and, while in Zongzhou, composed "Many Regions." Having revoked the mandate of Yin and subjugated the Huaiyi, he returned to Feng and composed "Offices of Zhou." He promoted proper rites and music, and the systems of measurement and regulation were reformed. The people lived in harmony, and songs of praise arose. After King Cheng had campaigned against the Eastern Yi, the Xishen came to offer congratulations. The King rewarded Rong Bo and composed the "Charge to Bribe the Xishen."

When King Cheng was about to die, he feared that Crown Prince Zhao would not be capable, so he ordered Zhao Gong and Bi Gong to lead the feudal lords to assist the Crown Prince and establish him. After King Cheng died, the two dukes led the feudal lords and presented Crown Prince Zhao at the ancestral temple of the former kings. They repeatedly informed him how King Wen and King Wu had established the royal enterprise with great difficulty, emphasizing the importance of frugality, not having many desires, and ruling with profound sincerity. They composed the "Testamentary Charge." Crown Prince Zhao was then established. This was King Kang. When King Kang ascended the throne, he announced to all the feudal lords, proclaiming the undertakings of King Wen and King Wu to reaffirm them, and composed the "Kang Gao" (Announcement to Kang). Therefore, during the time of Cheng and Kang, the realm was peaceful and tranquil, and punishments were set aside and not used for over forty years. King Kang ordered the composition of the "Bi Ming" (Charge to Bi Gong) regarding the division of residences and the suburbs of Chengzhou.

King Kang died, and his son King Zhao, Xia, was established. During King Zhao's time, the royal way slightly declined. King Zhao went on a southern inspection tour and did not return, dying on the Jiang River. His death was not officially announced, as it was concealed. King Zhao's son Man was established. This was King Mu. When King Mu ascended the throne, he was already fifty years old. The royal way was in decline. King Mu lamented the decline of the way of King Wen and King Wu, so he ordered Bo Jiong to reiterate the admonitions to the Grand Servant regarding the governance of the state, composing the "Jiong Ming" (Charge to Jiong). Tranquility was restored.

King Mu was about to campaign against the Quanrong. Ji Gong Moufu remonstrated, saying: "It is not permissible. The former kings displayed their virtue, not their armies. When armies are kept in reserve and mobilized at the right time, they inspire awe. If displayed, they become familiar, and if familiar, they lose their power to shock. Therefore, the ode of Duke Wen of Zhou says: 'We put away our shields and spears, we case our bows and arrows. I seek excellent virtue, to spread it throughout this great Xia. Truly, the King preserves it.' The former kings, in relation to the people, cultivated their virtue and enriched their nature, increased their wealth and resources, and improved their tools and implements. They clarified the directions of benefit and harm, and cultivated them through culture, causing them to pursue benefit and avoid harm, to cherish virtue and fear authority. Thus, they were able to preserve their lineage and grow great. Formerly, our ancestor Hou Ji served Yu and Xia. When Xia declined, they abandoned the duties of Minister of Agriculture. Our ancestor Buzhu lost his office and hid himself among the Rong and Di. He did not dare to neglect his duties, but ordered his virtue according to the seasons, followed and cultivated his legacy, and refined his teachings and regulations. Morning and evening, he was diligent and devoted, upholding them with sincerity and faithfulness. Generation after generation carried on this virtue, not shaming their predecessors. When it came to King Wen and King Wu, they illuminated the brilliance of their ancestors and added to it with kindness and harmony, serving the spirits and protecting the people, so that none were not joyful. King Di Xin of Shang committed great evils against the people. The common people could not bear it and joyfully supported King Wu, leading to war at the pasture of Shang. Therefore, the former kings did not prioritize military affairs, but rather sympathized with the people's suffering and removed their harms. The system of the former kings was: within the royal domain, the Dianæ (domain service); outside the royal domain, the Houæ (marquisate service); for the Hou and Wei, the Binæ (guest service); for the Yi and Man, the Yaoæ (restrained service); for the Rong and Di, the Huangæ (wild service). Those in the Dianæ performed sacrifices (ç¥­); those in the Houæ performed ancestral worship (ç¥); those in the Binæ presented offerings (äº«); those in the Yaoæ paid tribute (è²¢); those in the Huangæ acknowledged kingship (ç). Daily sacrifices, monthly ancestral worship, seasonal offerings, annual tribute, and lifelong acknowledgement of kingship. This was the orderly worship of the former kings. If there were no sacrifices, they cultivated their intent. If there were no ancestral worship, they cultivated their words. If there were no offerings, they cultivated their culture. If there were no tribute, they cultivated their reputation. If there were no acknowledgement of kingship, they cultivated their virtue. If, after these measures were taken, some still did not come, then they resorted to punishments. Thus, there were punishments for not sacrificing, attacks for not performing ancestral worship, expeditions for not presenting offerings, remonstrations for not paying tribute, and proclamations for not acknowledging kingship. Thus, there were laws for punishments, armies for attacks and campaigns, preparations for expeditions and conquests, commands for inspiring awe and remonstrance, and edicts for cultural proclamations. If, after issuing orders and making pronouncements, some still did not come, then they further cultivated their virtue, without troubling the people with distant expeditions. Therefore, those nearby all obeyed, and those far away all submitted. Now, since the end of Da Bi and Bo Shi, the Quanrong have come to acknowledge kingship according to their duty. If the Son of Heaven says, 'I must campaign against them for not presenting offerings, and moreover, display my army to them,' would this not be abandoning the teachings of the former kings, and would not the royal enterprise be on the verge of collapse? I have heard that the Quanrong uphold sincerity, follow ancient virtues, and maintain steadfast purity. They will have a way to resist us." The King proceeded with the campaign and returned with four white wolves and four white deer. From then on, those in the Huangæ (wild service) no longer came.

When some feudal lords were not harmonious, Marquis Fu spoke to the King, who then revised the penal code. The King said: "Ah, come! You who have states and lands, I will inform you about auspicious punishments. Now, for you to pacify the people, whom would you choose if not the right person? What would you respect if not the right punishment? Where would you reside if not in the proper place? When both parties are present, the judge listens to the five pleas. If the five pleas are simple and credible, they are judged according to the five punishments. If the five punishments are not simple, they are judged according to the five fines. If the five fines are not accepted, they are judged according to the five errors. For the flaws in the five errors, official and internal prisons should investigate and verify the crime, ensuring the error is judged fairly. If there is doubt regarding the five punishments, there is pardon. If there is doubt regarding the five fines, there is pardon. Investigate them thoroughly. If the simple and credible are many, then inquiries must be made. Do not be simple and without doubt; together, revere Heaven's majesty. For branding, if there is doubt, pardon; the fine is one hundred lÃ¼e (a unit of weight/currency); investigate and verify the crime. For cutting off the nose, if there is doubt, pardon; the fine is double that, sprinkled; investigate and verify the crime. For cutting off the feet, if there is doubt, pardon; the fine is double the difference; investigate and verify the crime. For castration, if there is doubt, pardon; the fine is five hundred lÃ¼e; investigate and verify the crime. For capital punishment, if there is doubt, pardon; the fine is one thousand lÃ¼e; investigate and verify the crime. The categories of branding fines number one thousand. The categories of nose-cutting fines number one thousand. The categories of foot-cutting fines number five hundred. The categories of castration fines number three hundred. The categories of capital punishment fines number two hundred: the categories of the five punishments total three thousand." This was called the "Fu Xing" (Punishments of Fu).

King Mu reigned for fifty-five years and died. His son, King Gong, Yihu, was established. King Gong was traveling on the Jing River, and Duke Kang of Mi accompanied him. Three women ran to him. Their mother said: "You must present them to the King. Three beasts make a herd, three men make a crowd, three women make a 'can' (brilliance/splendor). When the King hunts, he does not take a whole herd. When a Duke travels, he does not take a whole crowd. The King's chariot does not carry three from the same clan. 'Can' is a beautiful thing. If the crowd presents a beautiful thing to you, what virtue do you have to deserve it? Even the King cannot bear it, let alone a petty person like you! If a petty person possesses such things, he will eventually perish." Duke Kang did not present them. Within a year, King Gong destroyed Mi. King Gong died, and his son, King Yi, Jian, was established. During King Yi's time, the royal house further declined, and poets composed satires.

King Yi died, and King Gong's younger brother, Pifang, was established. This was King Xiao. King Xiao died, and the feudal lords re-established King Yi's Crown Prince Xie. This was King Yi (different from the previous King Yi, often distinguished as King YÃ­ å¤·ç vs King YÃ¬ æ¿ç).

King Yi (å¤·ç) died, and his son King Li, Hu, was established. In the thirtieth year of King Li's reign, he loved profit and favored Rong Yigong. Grand Master Rui Liangfu remonstrated with King Li, saying: "Will the royal house not decline? Duke Rong loves to monopolize profits and does not understand great calamities. Profit is what all things produce, what Heaven and Earth sustain. If someone monopolizes it, the harm will be great. Heaven and Earth and all things will take from it; how can it be monopolized? He will anger many and not be prepared for great calamities. If you teach the King this, how long can he last? A king is one who will guide profit and distribute it to those above and below. Even if he ensures that spirits, men, and all things attain their utmost, he should still be apprehensive day by day, fearing the arrival of resentment. Therefore, the 'Odes' say, 'Consider the accomplished Hou Ji, who could match Heaven above, established our teeming people, none without your utmost.' The 'Major Odes' say, 'Displaying and bestowing, he sustained Zhou.' Was this not because he distributed profit and feared calamity? Therefore, he was able to sustain Zhou until today. Now, if the King learns to monopolize profit, how can that be? If a common man monopolizes profit, he is still called a thief. If the King does it, few will follow him. If Duke Rong is employed, Zhou will surely be defeated." King Li did not listen and finally made Duke Rong a high minister, entrusting him with affairs.

The King acted tyrannically, extravagantly, and arrogantly. The people of the state criticized the King. Zhao Gong remonstrated, saying: "The people can no longer bear your commands." The King was angry, found a sorcerer from Wei, and had him monitor those who criticized. If reported, they were killed. Criticism became rare, and the feudal lords did not come to court. In the thirty-fourth year, the King became even stricter. No one in the state dared to speak; they communicated with their eyes on the roads. King Li was pleased and told Zhao Gong: "I have been able to stop the criticism; they no longer dare to speak." Zhao Gong said: "This is merely damming it up. Preventing the people's mouths is worse than damming water. If water is dammed and bursts, it will surely harm many people, and the people are the same. Therefore, those who manage water dredge it to guide it; those who manage people encourage them to speak. Thus, when the Son of Heaven listens to governance, he has high ministers down to ordinary officials present poems, blind musicians present tunes, historians present records, tutors offer admonitions, the elderly recite, the young chant, artisans remonstrate, commoners convey messages, close ministers offer full counsel, relatives supplement and observe, blind musicians and historians teach and admonish, and elders cultivate it. Then the King deliberates. This is why affairs proceed without going astray. That people have mouths is like the earth having mountains and rivers, from which wealth and resources come; it is like having plains and fertile lands, from which clothing and food are produced. When mouths speak out, good and bad arise from it. By doing good and preparing for bad, one produces wealth, resources, clothing, and food. People think in their hearts and express it with their mouths, and then act upon it. If their mouths are blocked, how much can they achieve?" The King did not listen. Consequently, no one in the state dared to speak out. After three years, they conspired together, rebelled, and attacked King Li. King Li fled to Zhi.

King Li's Crown Prince Jing hid in Zhao Gong's house. The people of the state heard of it and surrounded the house. Zhao Gong said: "In the past, I repeatedly remonstrated with the King, but he did not listen, leading to this disaster. If I now kill the King's Crown Prince, will the King consider me an enemy and harbor resentment and anger? One who serves a ruler, even in danger, does not become an enemy or harbor resentment; even if resentful, does not become angry. How much more so when serving the King!" So he substituted his own son for the King's Crown Prince, and the Crown Prince eventually escaped.

Zhao Gong and Zhou Gong (another Duke of Zhou, not Dan) jointly administered the government, calling it "Gonghe" (Joint Harmony). In the fourteenth year of Gonghe, King Li died at Zhi. Crown Prince Jing had grown up in Zhao Gong's house. The two ministers then jointly established him as King. This was King Xuan. When King Xuan ascended the throne, the two ministers assisted him, reformed the government, and followed the legacy of Kings Wen, Wu, Cheng, and Kang. The feudal lords again revered Zhou. In the twelfth year, Duke Wu of Lu came to court.

King Xuan did not perform the ritual plowing in the "thousand-mu" field. Duke Wen of Guo remonstrated, saying it was not permissible, but the King did not listen. In the thirty-ninth year, they fought at Qianmu, and the King's army was defeated by the Jiang Rong.

After King Xuan lost the army of the southern states, he counted the people at Taiyuan. Zhong Shanfu remonstrated, saying: "The people should not be counted." King Xuan did not listen and proceeded to count the people.

In the forty-sixth year, King Xuan died, and his son King You, Gongsheng, was established. In the second year of King You, all three rivers of Western Zhou experienced earthquakes. Boyang Fu said: "Zhou is about to perish. The qi of Heaven and Earth does not lose its order; if it exceeds its order, it is because the people have disordered it. Yang is suppressed and cannot emerge, Yin is oppressed and cannot steam upwards; thus, there are earthquakes. Now, the three rivers have indeed shaken; this is because Yang has lost its place and is filled by Yin. If Yang loses its place and is in Yin, the sources will surely be blocked; if the sources are blocked, the state will surely perish. Water and earth flow for the people's use. If the earth has no place to flow, and the people lack wealth and resources, what awaits but destruction! In the past, the Yi and Luo rivers dried up, and Xia perished; the Yellow River dried up, and Shang perished. Now, the virtue of Zhou is like that of the latter days of those two dynasties. Its rivers and sources are also blocked; if blocked, they will surely dry up. A state must rely on mountains and rivers. If mountains collapse and rivers dry up, it is a sign of a perishing state. If rivers dry up, mountains will surely collapse. If the state perishes, it will not be more than ten years; this is the cycle of numbers. What Heaven abandons does not exceed its cycle." In that year, the three rivers dried up, and Mount Qi collapsed.

In the third year, King You doted on Baosi. Baosi gave birth to a son, Bofu, and King You wanted to depose the Crown Prince. The Crown Prince's mother was the daughter of the Marquis of Shen and was the Queen. Later, King You obtained Baosi, loved her, and wanted to depose Queen Shen, and also remove Crown Prince Yijiu, making Baosi the Queen and Bofu the Crown Prince. The Grand Historian of Zhou, Boyang, read the historical records and said: "Zhou is doomed." In the past, since the decline of the Xiahou clan, two divine dragons stayed in the courtyard of the Xia Emperor and said: "We are the two lords of Bao." The Xia Emperor divined whether to kill them, drive them away, or let them stay; none were auspicious. He divined to request their saliva and store it, which was auspicious. So, they spread out offerings and announced it with inscribed slips. The dragons disappeared, and their saliva remained. It was put in a casket and stored away. When Xia perished, this casket was passed to Yin. When Yin perished, this casket was again passed to Zhou. Throughout these three dynasties, no one dared to open it. Towards the end of King Li's reign, he opened it and looked. The saliva flowed into the courtyard and could not be removed. King Li had women strip naked and shout at it. The saliva transformed into a black soft-shelled turtle and entered the King's rear palace. A young female slave in the rear palace, who had just lost her baby teeth, encountered it. When she reached the age of wearing a hairpin (adolescence), she became pregnant. Without a husband, she gave birth to a child, feared it, and abandoned it. During King Xuan's time, there was a children's rhyme: "Quivers of mulberry wood and bows of thornwood, will truly destroy the state of Zhou." When King Xuan heard this, there was a couple selling these items. King Xuan had them seized and executed. They fled on the road and saw the demon child abandoned by the young female slave from the rear palace by the roadside. Hearing its cries at night, they pitied it and took it in. The couple then fled and went to Bao. A man of Bao committed a crime and requested to offer the abandoned girl to the King to redeem his crime. The abandoned girl came from Bao; this was Baosi. In the third year of King You, the King saw her in the rear palace, loved her, and she gave birth to Bofu. He eventually deposed Queen Shen and the Crown Prince, making Baosi the Queen and Bofu the Crown Prince. Grand Historian Boyang said: "The disaster is complete; there is nothing that can be done!"

Baosi did not like to laugh. King You tried everything to make her laugh, but she would not. King You set up beacon fires and large drums; if bandits came, the beacon fires would be lit. The feudal lords all came, but when they arrived, there were no bandits. Baosi then laughed heartily. King You was pleased and lit the beacon fires several times. Afterwards, he lost credibility, and the feudal lords also stopped coming.

King You appointed Guo Shifu as a high minister, entrusting him with affairs. The people of the state all resented him. Shifu was a sycophant, skilled in flattery, and fond of profit; the King employed him. He also deposed Queen Shen and removed the Crown Prince. The Marquis of Shen was angry and, together with Zeng and the Western Yi Quanrong, attacked King You. King You lit the beacon fires to summon troops, but no troops came. They then killed King You at the foot of Mount Li, captured Baosi, and took all of Zhou's treasures before leaving. Thereupon, the feudal lords went to the Marquis of Shen and jointly established King You's former Crown Prince Yijiu. This was King Ping, to continue the sacrifices of Zhou.

King Ping was established and moved east to Luoyi to escape the Rong incursions. During King Ping's time, the Zhou royal house declined. Strong feudal lords annexed weaker ones. Qi, Chu, Qin, and Jin began to grow powerful. Governance was in the hands of regional hegemons.

In the forty-ninth year, Duke Yin of Lu ascended the throne.

In the fifty-first year, King Ping died. Crown Prince Xiefu had died early, so his son Lin was established. This was King Huan. King Huan was King Ping's grandson.

In the third year of King Huan, Duke Zhuang of Zheng came to court, and King Huan did not treat him with proper ceremony. In the fifth year, Zheng, resentful, exchanged the fields of Xu with Lu. The fields of Xu were used by the Son of Heaven for affairs at Mount Tai. In the eighth year, Lu killed Duke Yin and established Duke Huan. In the thirteenth year, he attacked Zheng. Zheng shot and wounded King Huan. King Huan retreated and returned.

In the twenty-third year, King Huan died, and his son King Zhuang, Tuo, was established. In the fourth year of King Zhuang, Zhou Gong Heijian wanted to kill King Zhuang and establish Prince Ke. Xin Bo informed the King, and the King killed Zhou Gong. Prince Ke fled to Yan.

In the fifteenth year, King Zhuang died, and his son King Xi, Huqi, was established. In the third year of King Xi, Duke Huan of Qi first became hegemon.

In the fifth year, King Xi died, and his son King Hui, Lang, was established. In the second year of King Hui. Previously, King Zhuang had favored Concubine Yao, who gave birth to a son, Tui. Tui was favored. When King Hui ascended the throne, he seized the lands of his great ministers to make a park. Therefore, Grand Master Bian Bo and four others started a rebellion, plotting to summon the armies of Yan and Wei to attack King Hui. King Hui fled to Wen and then resided in Li of Zheng. They established King Xi's younger brother Tui as King. There was music and widespread dancing. The rulers of Zheng and Guo were angry. In the fourth year, the rulers of Zheng and Guo attacked and killed King Tui, and restored King Hui. In the tenth year of King Hui, he granted Duke Huan of Qi the title of Hegemon.

In the twenty-fifth year, King Hui died, and his son King Xiang, Zheng, was established. King Xiang's mother died early. His stepmother was Queen Hui. Queen Hui gave birth to Shudai, who was favored by King Hui. King Xiang feared him. In the third year, Shudai conspired with the Rong and Di to attack King Xiang. King Xiang wanted to execute Shudai, but Shudai fled to Qi. Duke Huan of Qi sent Guan Zhong to pacify the Rong for Zhou and sent Xi Peng to pacify the Rong for Jin. The King treated Guan Zhong with the rites due to a high minister. Guan Zhong declined, saying: "Your humble servant is a lowly official. The Son of Heaven has two protectors, Guo and Gao. If they come to receive the King's orders in spring and autumn, with what ceremony will they be treated? Your subordinate minister dares to decline." The King said: "Uncle, I commend your merit; do not disobey my command." Guan Zhong finally accepted the rites of a junior minister and returned. In the ninth year, Duke Huan of Qi died. In the twelfth year, Shudai returned to Zhou.

In the thirteenth year, Zheng attacked Hua. The King sent You Sun and Bo Fu to request Hua from Zheng, but the men of Zheng imprisoned them. Duke Wen of Zheng resented that King Hui, upon his restoration, had not granted a title to Duke Li, and also resented that King Xiang sided with Wei regarding Hua. Therefore, he imprisoned Bo Fu. The King was angry and was about to attack Zheng with the Di. Fu Chen remonstrated, saying: "When our Zhou moved east, Jin and Zheng were our reliance. In the rebellion of Zisui, it was also Zheng that restored order. Now, because of a small resentment, you abandon them!" The King did not listen. In the fifteenth year, the King brought down the Di army to attack Zheng. The King favored the Di people and was about to make a Di woman his queen. Fu Chen remonstrated, saying: "Ping, Huan, Zhuang, and Hui all received meritorious service from Zheng. For the King to abandon kinship and favor the Di is not acceptable." The King did not listen. In the sixteenth year, the King dismissed the Di queen. The Di people came to punish, killing Tan Bo. Fu Chen said: "I have repeatedly remonstrated, but was not listened to. If I do not leave under such circumstances, will the King consider me resentful?" So he died with his followers.

Initially, Queen Hui wanted to establish Prince Dai. Therefore, she colluded with and opened the way for the Di people, and the Di people consequently entered Zhou. King Xiang fled to Zheng, and Zheng settled the King at Fan. Zidai was established as King, took King Xiang's dismissed Di queen, and lived with her at Wen. In the seventeenth year, King Xiang appealed to Jin for help. Duke Wen of Jin restored the King and executed Shudai. King Xiang then bestowed upon Duke Wen of Jin jade tablets, ceremonial wine, bows, and arrows, making him Hegemon, and gave the land of Henei to Jin. In the twentieth year, Duke Wen of Jin summoned King Xiang. King Xiang met him at Heyang and Jiantu. All the feudal lords came to court. The records euphemistically stated: "The Heavenly King hunted at Heyang."

In the twenty-fourth year, Duke Wen of Jin died.

In the thirty-first year, Duke Mu of Qin died.

In the thirty-second year, King Xiang died, and his son King Qing, Renchen, was established. In the sixth year of King Qing, he died, and his son King Kuang, Ban, was established. In the sixth year of King Kuang, he died, and his younger brother Yu was established. This was King Ding.

In the first year of King Ding, King Zhuang of Chu attacked the Rong of Luhun, advanced to Luo, and sent men to inquire about the Nine Tripods. The King sent Wangsun Man to respond with an elaborate speech, and the Chu army then withdrew. In the tenth year, King Zhuang of Chu besieged Zheng. The Count of Zheng surrendered, but was later restored. In the sixteenth year, King Zhuang of Chu died.

In the twenty-first year, King Ding died, and his son King Jian, Yi, was established. In the thirteenth year of King Jian, Jin killed its ruler Duke Li, welcomed Zizhou from Zhou, and established him as Duke Dao.

In the fourteenth year, King Jian died, and his son King Ling, Xiexin, was established. In the twenty-fourth year of King Ling, Cui Zhu of Qi assassinated his ruler Duke Zhuang.

In the twenty-seventh year, King Ling died, and his son King Jing, Gui, was established. In the eighteenth year of King Jing, the Crown Prince Sheng was sagacious but died early. In the twentieth year, King Jing loved his son Zhao and wanted to establish him. When the King died, the faction of his son Gai fought for the succession. The people of the state established the eldest son Meng as King. Zichao attacked and killed Meng. Meng was King Dao. The Jin people attacked Zichao and established Gai. This was King Jing (different from the previous King Jing, often distinguished as King JÃ¬ng æ¬ç vs King JÇng æ¯ç).

In the first year of King Jing (æ¬ç), the Jin people installed King Jing. Zichao established himself, and King Jing could not enter, residing at Ze. In the fourth year, Jin led the feudal lords to install King Jing in Zhou. Zichao became a minister. The feudal lords fortified Zhou. In the sixteenth year, Zichao's followers rebelled again. King Jing fled to Jin. In the seventeenth year, Duke Ding of Jin finally installed King Jing in Zhou.

In the thirty-ninth year, Tian Chang of Qi killed his ruler Duke Jian.

In the forty-first year, Chu destroyed Chen. Confucius died.

In the forty-second year, King Jing died, and his son King Yuan, Ren, was established. In the eighth year of King Yuan, he died, and his son King Ding (different from the previous King Ding, often distinguished as Zhending å®ç), Jie, was established.

In the sixteenth year of King Ding (Zhending å®ç), the three Jin states destroyed the Zhi Bo and divided his land.

In the twenty-eighth year, King Ding (Zhending å®ç) died. His eldest son Quji was established. This was King Ai. Three months after King Ai was established, his younger brother Shu attacked and killed King Ai and established himself. This was King Si. Five months after King Si was established, his younger brother Wei attacked and killed King Si and established himself. This was King Kao. These three kings were all sons of King Ding (Zhending å®ç).

In the fifteenth year of King Kao, he died, and his son King Weilie, Wu, was established.

King Kao enfeoffed his younger brother in Henan. This was Duke Huan, to continue the official duties of the Duke of Zhou. Duke Huan died, and his son Duke Wei succeeded him. Duke Wei died, and his son Duke Hui succeeded him. He then enfeoffed his younger son at Gong to serve the King, with the title Duke Hui of Eastern Zhou.

In the twenty-third year of King Weilie, the Nine Tripods shook. He appointed Han, Wei, and Zhao as feudal lords.

In the twenty-fourth year, he died, and his son King An, Jiao, was established. In this year, bandits killed King Sheng of Chu.

In the twenty-sixth year of King An's reign, he died, and his son King Lie, Xi, was established. In the second year of King Lie, Dan, the Grand Historian of Zhou, met Duke Xian of Qin and said: "Initially, Zhou and the state of Qin were united and then separated. After five hundred years of separation, they will reunite. Seventeen years after reuniting, a hegemon-king will emerge."

In the tenth year, King Lie died, and his younger brother Bian was established. This was King Xian. In the fifth year of King Xian, he congratulated Duke Xian of Qin, and Duke Xian assumed the title of Hegemon (Bo). In the ninth year, he sent sacrificial meats from King Wen and King Wu to Duke Xiao of Qin. In the twenty-fifth year, Qin held an assembly of feudal lords at Zhou. In the twenty-sixth year, Zhou conferred the title of Hegemon upon Duke Xiao of Qin. In the thirty-third year, he congratulated King Hui of Qin. In the thirty-fifth year, he sent sacrificial meats from King Wen and King Wu to King Hui of Qin. In the forty-fourth year, King Hui of Qin assumed the title of King. Thereafter, all the feudal lords became kings.

In the forty-eighth year, King Xian died, and his son King Shenjing, Ding, was established. Six years after King Shenjing was established, he died, and his son King Nan, Yan, was established. During King Nan's time, Eastern Zhou and Western Zhou were governed separately. King Nan moved his capital to Western Zhou.

When Crown Prince Gong of Duke Wu of Western Zhou died, he had five sons by concubines, but no legitimate heir was established. Sima Jian said to the King of Chu: "It would be better to provide land to support Prince Jiu and request that he be made Crown Prince." Zuo Cheng said: "This is not advisable. If Zhou does not listen, it will show that your wisdom is exhausted and your relations with Zhou are estranged. It would be better to ask the Lord of Zhou whom he wishes to establish, and subtly inform Jian. Jian can then request Chu to (congratulate) [provide] him with land." Indeed, Prince Jiu was established as Crown Prince.

In the eighth year, Qin attacked Yiyang, and Chu came to its rescue. Chu, believing Zhou was acting on behalf of Qin, was about to attack Zhou. Su Dai spoke to the King of Chu on behalf of Zhou, saying: "Why do you consider Zhou a calamity for Qin? Those who say Zhou acts for Qin more than for Chu wish to make Zhou join Qin, hence they say 'Zhou Qin.' If Zhou knows this cannot be resolved, it will surely join Qin. This is the essence of Qin taking Zhou. For Your Majesty's plan, if Zhou is on good terms with Qin, speak well of it; if not on good terms with Qin, also speak well of it, to alienate it from Qin. If Zhou breaks with Qin, it will surely come to Ying (capital of Chu)."

Qin requested passage between Eastern and Western Zhou to attack Han. Zhou feared that granting passage would incur Han's wrath, and not granting it would incur Qin's wrath. Shi Yan said to the Lord of Zhou: "Why not send someone to tell Han Gongshu: 'The reason Qin dares to bypass Zhou and attack Han is because it trusts Eastern Zhou. Why don't you give land to Zhou and send a hostage to Chu?' Qin will surely suspect Chu and not trust Zhou, so Han will not be attacked. Also, tell Qin: 'Han is forcefully giving land to Zhou to make Zhou suspect in Qin's eyes; Zhou dares not refuse.' Qin will surely have no pretext and order Zhou not to accept. Thus, you will receive land from Han and be listened to by Qin."

Qin summoned the Lord of Western Zhou. The Lord of Western Zhou was reluctant to go, so he sent someone to tell the King of Han: "Qin has summoned the Lord of Western Zhou to have him attack Your Majesty's Nanyang. Why don't you dispatch troops to Nanyang? The Lord of Zhou will use this as an excuse to Qin. If the Lord of Zhou does not go to Qin, Qin will surely not dare to cross the river and attack Nanyang."

Eastern Zhou fought with Western Zhou. Han came to the aid of Western Zhou. Someone spoke to the King of Han on behalf of Eastern Zhou, saying: "Western Zhou was formerly the state of the Son of Heaven and has many famous artifacts and valuable treasures. If Your Majesty holds back your troops and does not send them out, you can gain favor with Eastern Zhou, and all the treasures of Western Zhou will surely be obtained."

King Nan spoke to Cheng Jun. Chu besieged Yongshi. Han requisitioned armor and grain from Eastern Zhou. The Lord of Eastern Zhou was afraid, summoned Su Dai, and told him about it. Dai said: "Why does Your Lordship worry about this? I can make Han not requisition armor and grain from Zhou, and I can also obtain Gaodu for Your Lordship." The Lord of Zhou said: "If you can do this, I will entrust the state to you." Dai met the Prime Minister of Han and said: "Chu has besieged Yongshi for an expected three months, but now, after five months, they cannot take it. This means Chu is exhausted. Now, if the Prime Minister requisitions armor and grain from Zhou, it is telling Chu that it is exhausted." The Prime Minister of Han said: "Good. The envoys have already departed." Dai said: "Why not give Gaodu to Zhou?" The Prime Minister of Han was furious and said: "It is already a great concession for me not to requisition armor and grain from Zhou. Why should I give Gaodu to Zhou?" Dai said: "Giving Gaodu to Zhou means Zhou submits and joins Han. Qin, hearing of this, will surely be furious with Zhou and will not allow Zhou's envoys to pass. Thus, by sacrificing Gaodu, you gain the integrity of Zhou. Why not give it?" The Prime Minister said: "Good." And indeed, he gave Gaodu to Zhou.

In the thirty-fourth year, Su Li said to the Lord of Zhou: "Qin defeated Han and Wei, crushed the army of Shi Wu, and took Lin and Lishi from Zhao in the north. All this was accomplished by Bai Qi. He is skilled in warfare and also has the Mandate of Heaven. Now, he is again leading troops out of the passes to attack Liang. If Liang falls, Zhou will be in danger. Why doesn't Your Lordship send someone to persuade Bai Qi? Say: 'Chu had Yang Youji, a skilled archer. He could shoot a willow leaf from a hundred paces, hitting it a hundred times out of a hundred. Thousands of onlookers all praised his skill. A man stood beside him and said, "Good, you can be taught archery." Yang Youji was angry, put down his bow, grasped his sword, and said, "How can a guest teach me archery?" The guest said, "It is not that I can teach you to brace your left and bend your right. But to shoot a willow leaf from a hundred paces, hitting it a hundred times out of a hundred, without resting on your laurels, soon your energy will wane and your strength will tire, your bow will waver and your arrow will hook. If one shot misses, the achievement of a hundred hits is nullified." Now, you have defeated Han and Wei, crushed the army of Shi Wu, and taken Lin and Lishi from Zhao in the north; your merits are many. Now, you are again leading troops out of the passes, passing through the two Zhous, bypassing Han, to attack Liang. If this one campaign fails, all previous merits will be lost. It would be better for you to feign illness and not go out.'"

In the forty-second year, Qin broke the treaty of Huayang. Ma Fan said to the Lord of Zhou: "Please allow Liang to fortify Zhou." He then said to the King of Liang: "If the King of Zhou is ill or dies, Fan will surely die. Fan requests to bring the Nine Tripods to Your Majesty. Your Majesty receives the Nine Tripods and then considers Fan's situation." The King of Liang said: "Good." So he gave him troops, saying they were to garrison Zhou. He then said to the King of Qin: "Liang is not garrisoning Zhou; they are going to attack Zhou. Your Majesty, try sending troops to the border to observe." Qin indeed sent out troops. He then said to the King of Liang: "The King of Zhou is very ill. Fan requests to return after it is feasible. Now that Your Majesty has sent troops to Zhou, all the feudal lords are suspicious. If you act later, you will not be trusted. It would be better to order the troops to build fortifications for Zhou, to conceal the matter." The King of Liang said: "Good." So he had them build fortifications for Zhou.

In the forty-fifth year, a guest of the Lord of Zhou from Qin said to Zhou (Zui) [Ju]: "Your Grace should praise the King of Qin's filial piety and, accordingly, offer land for the Queen Dowager's maintenance. The King of Qin will surely be pleased, and thus Your Grace will have good relations with Qin. If relations are good, the Lord of Zhou will surely credit Your Grace. If relations are bad, those who urged the Lord of Zhou to join Qin will surely be blamed." Qin attacked Zhou, and Zhou Ju said to the King of Qin: "For Your Majesty's plan, do not attack Zhou. Attacking Zhou brings insufficient benefit, but a reputation for inspiring fear in the world. If the world fears Qin because of its reputation, they will surely unite with Qi in the east. If troops are exhausted at Zhou and the world unites with Qi, then Qin will not become hegemon. The world wants to exhaust Qin and urges Your Majesty to attack Zhou. If Qin and the world are exhausted, then your orders will not be carried out."

In the fifty-eighth year, the three Jin states resisted Qin. Zhou ordered its prime minister to go to Qin. Believing Qin to be of little consequence, he turned back. A guest said to the prime minister: "The importance of Qin is yet unknown. Qin wants to know the situation of the three states. Your Grace should quickly see the King of Qin and say, 'Please allow me to listen for changes in the East for Your Majesty.' The King of Qin will surely value Your Grace. If he values Your Grace, it means Qin values Zhou, and Zhou can gain from Qin. If Qi is important, then there is already Zhou Ju to secure Qi. Thus, Zhou will never lose the alliance of an important state." Qin trusted Zhou and dispatched troops to attack the three Jin states.

In the fifty-ninth year, Qin took Yangcheng and Fushu from Han. Western Zhou, fearing, turned against Qin and made an alliance with the feudal lords, leading the elite troops of the world out of Yique to attack Qin, to prevent Qin from reaching Yangcheng. King Zhao of Qin was angry and sent General Jiao to attack Western Zhou. The Lord of Western Zhou fled to Qin, kowtowed, and admitted his guilt, offering all his thirty-six towns and thirty thousand people. Qin accepted his offering and returned its lord to Zhou.

The Lord of Zhou and King Nan died. The people of Zhou then fled eastward. Qin took the Nine Tripods and precious artifacts, and moved Duke Gong of Western Zhou to Danhu. Seven years later, King Zhuangxiang of Qin destroyed Eastern (Western) Zhou. Both Eastern and Western Zhou were incorporated into Qin, and Zhou was no longer sacrificed to.

The Grand Historian says: Scholars all say that Zhou attacked Zhou (King of Shang), resided in Luoyi; in reality, this is not so. King Wu planned it, King Cheng had Zhao Gong divine the residence, and placed the Nine Tripods there, but Zhou re-established its capitals at Feng and Hao. It was not until the Quanrong defeated King You that Zhou moved east to Luoyi. What is called "Zhou Gong was buried (by me) [at] Bi," Bi is in Du, southeast of Hao. Qin destroyed Zhou. More than ninety years after the Han dynasty rose, the Son of Heaven was about to perform the Feng and Shan sacrifices at Mount Tai. On an eastern inspection tour, he reached Henan, sought out descendants of Zhou, enfeoffed a descendant named Jia with a territory of thirty li, titled him Lord Zinan of Zhou, ranking him with feudal lords, to carry on the sacrifices to his ancestors.
