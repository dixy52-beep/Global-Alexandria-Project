**Annals of Qin:**

The ancestor of Qin was a female descendant of Emperor Zhuanxu, named Nü Xiu. Nü Xiu was weaving when a dark bird dropped an egg. Nü Xiu swallowed it and gave birth to a son, Da Ye. Da Ye took a daughter of Shaodian, named Nü Hua. Nü Hua gave birth to Da Fei, who, with Yu, controlled the floods and lands. When this was accomplished, the Emperor bestowed upon him a dark jade tablet. Yu received it and said, "It was not I who accomplished this, but Da Fei who assisted me." Emperor Shun said, "Oh, Fei, you assisted Yu in his achievements. I shall grant you a black banner with tassels. Your descendants will become numerous and prominent." He then gave him in marriage a jade lady of the Yao surname. Da Fei kowtowed and accepted. He assisted Shun in taming birds and beasts, and many birds and beasts became tame. He was known as Bo Yi. Shun bestowed upon him the surname Ying.

**Annals of Qin:**

Da Fei had two sons: one was named Da Lian, who was the ancestor of the Niaosu clan; the other was named Ruo Mu, who was the ancestor of the Fei clan. His great-great-grandson was named Fei Chang. Some of his descendants were in the central states, while others were among the Yi and Di peoples. During the time of Jie of Xia, Fei Chang left Xia and submitted to Shang, serving as charioteer for Tang, and defeated Jie at Mingtiao. Da Lian's great-great-grandsons were Meng Xi and Zhong Yan, who had bird bodies and human speech. Emperor Taiwu heard of them and, after divination, had them serve as his charioteers. It was auspicious, so he employed them as charioteers and gave them wives. From Taiwu onwards, the descendants of Zhong Yan served the Yin state with merit for generations. Therefore, many with the Ying surname became prominent and eventually became feudal lords.

**Annals of Qin:**

His great-great-grandson was named Zhong Jue, who lived among the Western Rong and protected the western frontier. He fathered Feilian. Feilian fathered Elai. Elai was strong, and Feilian was a swift runner; father and son both served King Zhou of Yin with their talents and strength. When King Wu of Zhou attacked Zhou, he also killed Elai. At that time, Feilian was fortifying the north for Zhou. Upon his return, having nowhere to report, he built an altar on Mount Huo Tai to report, and found a stone coffin inscribed: "The Emperor orders Chufu not to participate in the Yin disorder, and grants you this stone coffin to honor your clan." He died and was buried on Mount Huo Tai. Feilian also had a son named Ji Sheng. Ji Sheng fathered Meng Zeng. Meng Zeng was favored by King Cheng of Zhou and was known as Zhai Gaolang. Gaolang fathered Hengfu, and Hengfu fathered Zaofu. Zaofu, due to his skill in charioteering, was favored by King Mu of Zhou. He obtained the four-horse teams of Ji, Wenli, Hualiu, and Luer. He went on a western inspection tour and, enjoying himself, forgot to return. King Yan of Xu started a rebellion. Zaofu drove King Mu's chariot, racing back to Zhou, covering a thousand li in a single day to quell the rebellion. King Mu enfeoffed Zaofu with the city of Zhao, and Zaofu's clan thereupon took the surname Zhao. From Feilian who begat Ji Sheng, down five generations to Zaofu, they lived separately in Zhao. Zhao Cui was his descendant. Elai Ge, Feilian's son, died early. He had a son named Nü Fang. Nü Fang fathered Pang Gao, Pang Gao fathered Taiji, Taiji fathered Da Luo, and Da Luo fathered Feizi. Due to Zaofu's favor, they all received association with Zhao city and took the surname Zhao.

**Annals of Qin:**

Feizi lived in Quanqiu, loved horses and livestock, and was skilled in raising them. The people of Quanqiu spoke of him to King Xiao of Zhou. King Xiao summoned him and put him in charge of horses between the Qian and Wei rivers, and the horses greatly multiplied. King Xiao wanted to make him Da Luo's legitimate heir. The daughter of Marquis Shen was Da Luo's wife and had borne a son, Cheng, who was the legitimate heir. Marquis Shen then said to King Xiao: "In the past, my ancestress, a daughter from Mount Li, was the wife of Rong Xuxuan and bore Zhong Jue. Due to kinship, he returned to Zhou and protected the western frontier, and because of this, the western frontier was harmonious. Now, I have again married a daughter to Da Luo, who bore the legitimate son Cheng. With the repeated marriages between Shen and Luo, the Western Rong all submit, which is why you are king. May Your Majesty consider this." Thereupon, King Xiao said: "In the past, Bo Yi was in charge of livestock for Shun, and the livestock multiplied greatly, so he was given land and the surname Ying. Now, his descendant has also bred horses for me. I shall grant him land as a vassal." He enfeoffed him in Qin, allowed him to continue the sacrifices of the Ying clan, and he was called Qin Ying. He also did not depose Marquis Shen's daughter as Da Luo's legitimate wife, in order to maintain harmony with the Western Rong.

**Annals of Qin:**

Qin Ying fathered Marquis of Qin. Marquis of Qin reigned for ten years and died. He fathered Gongbo. Gongbo reigned for three years and died. He fathered Qin Zhong.

**Annals of Qin:**

Qin Zhong had reigned for three years when King Li of Zhou was without principles, and some feudal lords rebelled against him. The Western Rong revolted against the royal house and annihilated the clan of Da Luo of Quanqiu. When King Xuan of Zhou ascended the throne, he made Qin Zhong a Daifu (Grand Officer) to punish the Western Rong. The Western Rong killed Qin Zhong. Qin Zhong had reigned for twenty-three years and died at the hands of the Rong. He had five sons, the eldest of whom was Duke Zhuang. King Xuan of Zhou then summoned Duke Zhuang and his four brothers, gave them seven thousand troops, and sent them to attack the Western Rong, defeating them. Thereupon, he restored to Qin Zhong's descendants their ancestor Da Luo's land of Quanqiu, which they possessed, and made him Daifu of the Western Frontier.

**Annals of Qin:**

Duke Zhuang resided in his old territory of West Quanqiu and fathered three sons, the eldest of whom was Shifu. Shifu said: "The Rong killed my grandfather Zhong. If I do not kill the Rong king, I dare not enter the city." He then led an attack against the Rong and yielded the succession to his younger brother, Duke Xiang. Duke Xiang became the crown prince. Duke Zhuang reigned for forty-four years and died. Crown Prince Xiang succeeded him. In the first year of Duke Xiang, he married his younger sister Miao Ying to King Feng. In the second year of Duke Xiang, the Rong besieged Quanqiu. Shifu attacked them and was captured by the Rong. After more than a year, Shifu was returned. In the spring of the seventh year, King You of Zhou, influenced by Bao Si, deposed the crown prince and made Bao Si's son the heir. He repeatedly deceived the feudal lords, who rebelled against him. The Western Rong, Quanrong, and Marquis Shen attacked Zhou and killed King You at the foot of Mount Li. Duke Xiang of Qin led troops to rescue Zhou, fought with great effort, and achieved merit. Zhou, fleeing the Quanrong calamity, moved east to Luoyi. Duke Xiang escorted King Ping of Zhou with troops. King Ping enfeoffed Duke Xiang as a feudal lord and granted him the land west of Qi. He said: "The Rong are without principles and have invaded and seized our lands of Qi and Feng. If Qin can attack and expel the Rong, they shall possess that land." He made a covenant and granted him a noble rank. Duke Xiang thus established his state and engaged in diplomatic missions and ceremonies with other feudal lords. He then used three of each: sorrel colts, yellow oxen, and rams, to sacrifice to the Supreme Deity at the Western Altar (Xizhi). In the twelfth year, he attacked the Rong and reached Qi, where he died. He fathered Duke Wen.

**Annals of Qin:**

In the first year of Duke Wen, he resided in the West Frontier Palace. In the third year, Duke Wen went hunting in the east with seven hundred men. In the fourth year, he reached the confluence of the Qian and Wei rivers. He said: "In the past, Zhou enfeoffed my ancestor Qin Ying here, and later he finally became a feudal lord." He then divined for a place to reside. The divination was auspicious, and he immediately established a settlement there. In the tenth year, he first established the Fu Altar (Fuzhi) and used the sacrifice of three sets of animals (sanlao). In the thirteenth year, he first appointed historians to record events, and many people were civilized. In the sixteenth year, Duke Wen attacked the Rong with troops, and the Rong were defeated and fled. Duke Wen then gathered the remaining people of Zhou and possessed the land up to Qi. The land east of Qi was presented to Zhou. In the nineteenth year, he obtained the Chen Bao (Treasure of Chen). In the twentieth year, the law of punishing three kindred groups was first established. In the twenty-seventh year, he felled large catalpa trees on the South Mountain, and the Feng river had a great flood. In the forty-eighth year, Duke Wen's crown prince died and was posthumously named Duke Jing. Duke Jing's eldest son became the crown prince; he was Duke Wen's grandson. In the fiftieth year, Duke Wen died and was buried on the West Mountain. Duke Jing's son ascended the throne, and he was Duke Ning.

In the third year, he fought with Bo, and the King of Bo fled to the Rong; thereupon, Dangshe was annihilated. In the fourth year, Prince Hui of Lu assassinated his ruler, Duke Yin. In the twelfth year, he attacked the Dang clan and captured their territory. Duke Ning was ten years old when he ascended the throne, reigned for twelve years, and died. He was buried on the West Mountain. He fathered three sons; the eldest, Duke Wu, was the crown prince. Duke Wu's younger brother, Duke De, was by the same mother, Lady Ji of Lu. She also bore Chuzi. When Duke Ning died, the Grand Steward Fuji, Weilei, and Sanfu deposed the crown prince and installed Chuzi as ruler. In the sixth year of Chuzi, Sanfu and others again conspired to have Chuzi assassinated. Chuzi was five years old when he ascended the throne, reigned for six years, and died. Sanfu and others then reinstalled the former crown prince, Duke Wu.

**Annals of Qin:**

**Annals of Qin:**

In the fifth year, Duke Xian of Jin annihilated Yu and Guo, capturing the ruler of Yu and his grand officer Baili Xi, because he had previously bribed Yu with jade discs and horses. After capturing Baili Xi, he sent him as part of the dowry of Duke Mu of Qin's wife to Qin. Baili Xi fled from Qin to Wan, where he was captured by a border official of Chu. Duke Mu heard that Baili Xi was a worthy man and wished to redeem him with a large sum, but feared the Chu people would not agree. So he sent a messenger to Chu saying: "My dowry servant Baili Xi is there; I request to redeem him with five ram skins." The Chu people agreed and gave him up. At that time, Baili Xi was already over seventy years old. Duke Mu released him from his bonds and spoke with him about state affairs. Baili Xi declined, saying: "I am a minister of a vanquished state; what is there to ask?" Duke Mu said: "The ruler of Yu did not use you, so his state perished; it is not your fault." He insisted on asking, and they talked for three days. Duke Mu was greatly pleased and entrusted him with the government, calling him the "Five Ram Skin Grand Officer." Baili Xi demurred, saying: "I am not as good as my friend Jian Shu. Jian Shu is worthy, but the world does not know him. I was once traveling and in distress in Qi, begging for food from the people of Zhi, and Jian Shu took me in. I then wanted to serve Wuzhi, ruler of Qi, but Jian Shu stopped me, and I escaped the troubles in Qi and went to Zhou. Prince Tui of Zhou was fond of oxen, and I sought his favor by tending oxen. When Tui wanted to employ me, Jian Shu stopped me. I left and was not executed. I served the ruler of Yu, and Jian Shu stopped me. I knew the ruler of Yu would not use me, but I selfishly desired salary and rank and stayed. Twice I followed his words and escaped; once I did not, and I met with the disaster of the ruler of Yu. Thus, I know his worth." Thereupon, Duke Mu sent men with rich gifts to welcome Jian Shu and made him High Grand Officer.

**Annals of Qin:**

In autumn, Duke Mu personally led an attack on Jin and fought at Hequ. Liji of Jin caused turmoil; Crown Prince Shensheng died at Xincheng, and Chong'er and Yiwu fled.

**Annals of Qin:**

In the ninth year, Duke Huan of Qi held an assembly of feudal lords at Kuqiu.

**Annals of Qin:**

Duke Xian of Jin died. Liji's son Xiqi was installed, but his minister Li Ke killed Xiqi. Xun Xi installed Zhuozi, but Ke killed Zhuozi and Xun Xi as well. Yiwu sent a messenger to Qin, requesting to enter Jin. Duke Mu agreed and sent Baili Xi with troops to escort Yiwu. Yiwu said: "If I indeed become ruler, I request to cede the eight cities west of the Yellow River in Jin to Qin." When he arrived and was installed, he sent Pi Zheng to thank Qin but reneged on the promise and did not give the cities west of the River, and he killed Li Ke. Pi Zheng heard of this, was afraid, and conspired with Duke Mu, saying: "The people of Jin do not want Yiwu; they actually want Chong'er. Now he has broken his promise to Qin and killed Li Ke; this was all the scheme of Lü Sheng and Xi Rui. I wish Your Lordship would urgently summon Lü and Xi with an offer of benefits. When Lü and Xi arrive, then it will be convenient to install Chong'er instead." Duke Mu agreed and sent men with Pi Zheng to return and summon Lü and Xi. Lü, Xi, and others suspected Pi Zheng of treachery and told Yiwu to kill Pi Zheng. Pi Zheng's son Pi Bao fled to Qin and advised Duke Mu, saying: "The ruler of Jin is without principles, and the common people do not support him. He can be attacked." Duke Mu said: "If the common people are truly discontented, how could he execute his high ministers? That he can execute his high ministers shows he is in control." He did not listen but secretly employed Bao.

**Annals of Qin:**

In the twelfth year, Guan Zhong and Xi Peng of Qi died.

**Annals of Qin:**

Jin suffered a drought and came to request grain. Pi Bao advised Duke Mu not to give it and to attack them during their famine. Duke Mu asked Gongsun Zhi. Zhi said: "Famine and plenty are alternating affairs; one cannot refuse to give." He asked Baili Xi. Xi said: "Yiwu has offended Your Lordship, but what crime have his people committed?" So, he followed the words of Baili Xi and Gongsun Zhi and finally gave them grain. It was transported by boat and cart, a continuous line from Yong to Jiang.

**Annals of Qin:**

In the fourteenth year, Qin suffered a famine and requested grain from Jin. The ruler of Jin consulted his ministers. Guo She said: "Attack them during their famine, and a great achievement can be made." The ruler of Jin followed his advice. In the fifteenth year, he raised troops and was about to attack Qin. Duke Mu dispatched troops, made Pi Bao their general, and went himself to attack them. On the renxu day of the ninth month, he engaged in battle with Duke Hui of Jin, Yiwu, at Han. The ruler of Jin abandoned his army and contended with Qin for advantage; he turned back, and his horse stumbled. Duke Mu and his retinue galloped in pursuit but could not catch the ruler of Jin, and were instead surrounded by the Jin army. Jin attacked Duke Mu, and Duke Mu was wounded. Then, three hundred men from the foot of Mount Qi who had eaten his fine horse galloped into the Jin army. The Jin army broke the siege, thus rescuing Duke Mu and, in turn, capturing the ruler of Jin alive. Previously, Duke Mu had lost a fine horse. More than three hundred commoners from the foot of Mount Qi had found and eaten it. Officials pursued and caught them, intending to punish them according to law. Duke Mu said: "A gentleman does not harm people because of livestock. I have heard that eating the meat of a fine horse without drinking wine harms a person." He then gave them all wine and pardoned them. These three hundred men, hearing that Qin was attacking Jin, all requested to follow. Following him and seeing Duke Mu in dire straits, they all pushed forward, vying to die, to repay the kindness of the horse meat. Thus, Duke Mu captured the ruler of Jin and returned, issuing an order to the state: "Purify yourselves and fast; I will sacrifice the ruler of Jin to the Supreme Deity." The Son of Heaven of Zhou heard of this and said, "Jin is of my same surname," and pleaded for the ruler of Jin. Yiwu's elder sister was also Duke Mu's wife. When she heard of this, she wore mourning clothes and went barefoot, saying: "My brothers cannot save each other, thus insulting your command." Duke Mu said: "I captured the ruler of Jin as an achievement. Now the Son of Heaven pleads for him, and my wife is worried." He then made a covenant with the ruler of Jin, promising to return him, moved him to better quarters, and feasted him with seven sets of sacrificial animals. In the eleventh month, he returned Yiwu, the ruler of Jin. Yiwu presented his land west of the Yellow River and sent Crown Prince Yu as a hostage to Qin. Qin married a daughter of the ruling house to Yu. At this time, Qin's territory extended east to the Yellow River.

**Annals of Qin:**

In the eighteenth year, Duke Huan of Qi died. In the twentieth year, Qin annihilated Liang and Rui.

**Annals of Qin:**

In the twenty-second year, Prince Yu of Jin heard that the ruler of Jin was ill and said: "Liang was my mother's home, and Qin annihilated it. I have many brothers. If the ruler lives a hundred years and then dies, Qin will surely detain me, and Jin, being weak, will install another son." Prince Yu then fled back to Jin. In the twenty-third year, Duke Hui of Jin died, and Prince Yu was installed as ruler. Qin resented Yu's flight and welcomed Prince Chong'er of Jin from Chu, marrying him to the former wife of Prince Yu. Chong'er initially declined but later accepted. Duke Mu treated him with increased rites and generosity. In the spring of the twenty-fourth year, Qin sent a messenger to inform the high ministers of Jin of its desire to install Chong'er. Jin agreed, and thereupon sent men to escort Chong'er. In the second month, Chong'er was installed as ruler of Jin; he was Duke Wen. Duke Wen sent men to kill Prince Yu. Prince Yu was known as Duke Huai.

**Annals of Qin:**

In the autumn of that year, Dai, the younger brother of King Xiang of Zhou, attacked the King with the Di people. The King fled and resided in Zheng. In the twenty-fifth year, the King of Zhou sent a messenger to Jin and Qin to report the calamity. Duke Mu of Qin led troops to assist Duke Wen of Jin in reinstating King Xiang and killed the King's younger brother, Dai. In the twenty-eighth year, Duke Wen of Jin defeated Chu at Chengpu. In the thirtieth year, Duke Mu assisted Duke Wen of Jin in besieging Zheng. Zheng sent a messenger to Duke Mu, saying: "Destroying Zheng strengthens Jin, which benefits Jin, but Qin gains nothing. Jin's strength is Qin's worry." Duke Mu then withdrew his troops and returned. Jin also withdrew. In the winter of the thirty-second year, Duke Wen of Jin died.

**Annals of Qin:**

A man from Zheng offered to betray Zheng to Qin, saying: "I control its city gate; Zheng can be surprise-attacked." Duke Mu consulted Jian Shu and Baili Xi. They replied: "To traverse several states and a thousand li to launch a surprise attack on someone, rarely does one gain an advantage. Moreover, if a man betrays Zheng, how do we know that someone from our state has not informed Zheng of our intentions? It is not feasible." Duke Mu said: "You do not understand; I have already decided." He then dispatched troops, making Baili Xi's son Mengming Shi, Jian Shu's son Xi Qishu, and Bai Yibing generals. On the day of departure, Baili Xi and Jian Shu both wept for them. Duke Mu heard this and angrily said: "I am dispatching troops, and you discourage and weep for my army. Why?" The two old men said: "We dare not discourage Your Lordship's army. The army is departing, and our sons are going with it; we are old, and if they return late, we fear we may not see them again, so we weep." The two old men withdrew and said to their sons: "If your army is defeated, it will surely be at the Yao pass." In the spring of the thirty-third year, the Qin army advanced eastward, passed through Jin territory, and went by the north gate of Zhou. Wangsun Man of Zhou said: "The Qin army is discourteous; if it is not defeated, what are we waiting for!" The army reached Hua. Xian Gao, a merchant from Zheng, was taking twelve oxen to sell in Zhou. Seeing the Qin army, he feared being killed or captured, so he presented his oxen, saying: "I have heard that the great state is about to punish Zheng. The ruler of Zheng has carefully strengthened his defenses and preparations and sent me with twelve oxen to reward your soldiers." The three Qin generals conferred, saying: "We were going to launch a surprise attack on Zheng, but Zheng is now aware of it. It is too late to go." They annihilated Hua. Hua was a border town of Jin.

**Annals of Qin:**

At that time, Duke Wen of Jin's mourning period was not yet over. Crown Prince Xiang was enraged and said: "Qin insults me, an orphan, and takes advantage of the mourning to destroy my city of Hua." He then put on black mourning clothes, dispatched troops to intercept the Qin army at Yao, attacked them, and utterly defeated the Qin army; not a single man escaped. He captured the three Qin generals and returned. Duke Wen's wife, a Qin princess, pleaded for the three captive Qin generals, saying: "Duke Mu's resentment towards these three men is bone-deep. I wish these three men could be returned, so that my lord can have the satisfaction of personally boiling them." The ruler of Jin agreed and returned the three Qin generals. When the three generals arrived, Duke Mu, dressed in plain clothes, met them in the suburbs and, facing the three men, wept, saying: "It is I who, by not using the words of Baili Xi and Jian Shu, have brought shame upon you three. What crime have you three committed? You must wholeheartedly wipe out this shame and not be lax." He then restored the three men to their former ranks and positions and treated them with even greater generosity.

**Annals of Qin:**

In the thirty-fourth year, Crown Prince Shangchen of Chu assassinated his father, King Cheng, and took the throne.

**Annals of Qin:**

Duke Mu then again sent Mengming Shi and others with troops to attack Jin, and they fought at Pengya. Qin was not successful and withdrew its troops.

**Annals of Qin:**

The Rong King sent You Yu to Qin. You Yu's ancestors were from Jin; he had fled to the Rong and could speak the Jin language. Hearing that Duke Mu was worthy, the Rong King sent You Yu to observe Qin. Duke Mu of Qin showed him his palaces and storehouses. You Yu said: "If ghosts were made to do this, it would tire the spirits. If men were made to do this, it would also oppress the people." Duke Mu found this strange and asked: "The central states govern with odes, documents, rites, music, laws, and regulations, yet there is still frequent disorder. Now the Rong and Yi have none of these; how do they achieve governance? Is it not difficult?" You Yu laughed and said: "This is precisely why the central states are in disorder. Since the sage Yellow Emperor created rites, music, laws, and regulations, and personally led by example, he barely achieved minor governance. His later generations became increasingly arrogant and licentious. They relied on the authority of laws and regulations to reprimand and supervise those below. When those below were exhausted to the extreme, they resented and looked to those above with talk of benevolence and righteousness. Superiors and inferiors vied in resentment and usurped and assassinated each other, even to the point of exterminating clans; all such cases are of this kind. The Rong and Yi are not like this. Superiors treat their inferiors with pure virtue, and inferiors serve their superiors with loyalty and faith. The governance of an entire state is like the governance of a single body; they do not know how it is governed. This is truly the governance of a sage." Thereupon, Duke Mu withdrew and asked his Inner Scribe Liao: "I have heard that a sage in a neighboring state is a worry for a rival state. Now You Yu is worthy, a harm to me. What should be done?" Inner Scribe Liao said: "The Rong King lives in a remote and secluded place and has not heard the music of the central states. Your Lordship should try sending him female musicians to distract his will; make requests on behalf of You Yu to create distance between them; detain You Yu and not send him back, so he misses his appointed time. The Rong King will find this strange and will surely suspect You Yu. When there is a rift between ruler and minister, then he can be captured. Moreover, the Rong King is fond of music and will surely neglect his government." Duke Mu said: "Good." He then sat with You Yu on curved mats, passed around vessels for food, and inquired thoroughly about his terrain and military strength. Afterwards, he ordered Inner Scribe Liao to send two sets of eight female musicians to the Rong King. The Rong King received them and was delighted, and did not return for a whole year. Then Qin returned You Yu. You Yu repeatedly advised, but was not heeded. Duke Mu also repeatedly sent men to secretly solicit You Yu. You Yu finally left and surrendered to Qin. Duke Mu received him with the rites due to a guest and asked about the strategy for attacking the Rong.

**Annals of Qin:**

In the thirty-sixth year, Duke Mu again treated Mengming and others with increased generosity and sent them with troops to attack Jin. They crossed the Yellow River, burned their boats, greatly defeated the Jin forces, and captured Wangguan and Hao, in retaliation for the Battle of Yao. The Jin people all defended their cities and dared not come out. Duke Mu then crossed the Yellow River from Maojin, sealed the corpses at Yao, held a funeral service, and mourned for them for three days. He then swore an oath to the army, saying: "Alas, soldiers! Listen without clamor, I swear to inform you. The ancients consulted the grey-haired and venerable, and thus made no mistakes." This was to reflect on not using the counsel of Jian Shu and Baili Xi, and therefore he made this oath, so that later generations would remember his error. Gentlemen who heard of it all shed tears, saying: "Alas! Duke Mu of Qin's thoroughness with people ultimately led to the good fortune brought by Mengming."

**Annals of Qin:**

In the thirty-seventh year, Qin, using You Yu's strategy, attacked the Rong King, added twelve states, opened up a thousand li of territory, and thus became hegemon of the Western Rong. The Son of Heaven sent Duke Zhao Guo to congratulate Duke Mu with gold drums. In the thirty-ninth year, Duke Mu died and was buried at Yong. One hundred and seventy-seven people followed him in death. Three of Qin's worthy ministers from the Ziyu clan, named Yanxi, Zhonghang, and Zhenhu, were also among those who followed him in death. The people of Qin mourned them and composed the poem "Yellow Bird." Gentlemen said: "Duke Mu of Qin expanded territory and added states, subdued the strong Jin in the east, and became hegemon of the Rong and Yi in the west. However, he did not become the leader of the feudal lords' alliance, and rightly so. Upon his death, he abandoned the people, taking his worthy ministers to follow him in death. Even when former kings passed away, they still left behind virtue and established laws; how much more so when he took away good men and worthy ministers whom the common people mourned? Thus, it is known that Qin could no longer campaign eastward." Duke Mu had forty sons. His crown prince, Ying, succeeded him and was known as Duke Kang.

**Annals of Qin:**

First year of Duke Kang. In the previous year when Duke Mu died, Duke Xiang of Jin also died; Duke Xiang's younger brother, named Yong, was from Qin and was in Qin. Zhao Dun of Jin wanted to install him and sent Sui Hui to welcome Yong. Qin escorted him with troops to Linghu. Jin installed Duke Xiang's son and instead attacked the Qin army. The Qin army was defeated, and Sui Hui fled to Qin. In the second year, Qin attacked Jin and took Wucheng, in retaliation for the Linghu campaign. In the fourth year, Jin attacked Qin and took Shaoliang. In the sixth year, Qin attacked Jin and took Jima. They fought at Hequ and greatly defeated the Jin army. The Jin people worried that Sui Hui in Qin was causing trouble, so they had Wei Chouyu feign rebellion, conspire with Hui, and deceitfully capture Hui. Hui then returned to Jin. Duke Kang reigned for twelve years and died. His son, Duke Gong, ascended the throne.

**Annals of Qin:**

In the second year of Duke Gong, Zhao Chuan of Jin assassinated his ruler, Duke Ling. In the third year, King Zhuang of Chu was powerful, his northern troops reached Luo, and he inquired about the tripods of Zhou. Duke Gong reigned for five years and died. His son, Duke Huan, ascended the throne.

**Annals of Qin:**

In the third year of Duke Huan, Jin defeated one of our generals. In the tenth year, King Zhuang of Chu subjugated Zheng and defeated the Jin army north of the Yellow River. At that time, Chu was hegemonic and held alliances with the feudal lords. In the twenty-fourth year, Duke Li of Jin, newly enthroned, made an alliance with Duke Huan of Qin on opposite banks of the Yellow River. After returning, Qin broke the alliance and conspired with the Di to attack Jin. In the twenty-sixth year, Jin led the feudal lords to attack Qin. The Qin army was defeated and fled, pursued to the Jing River before turning back. Duke Huan reigned for twenty-seven years and died. His son, Duke Jing, ascended the throne.

**Annals of Qin:**

In the fourth year of Duke Jing, Luan Shu of Jin assassinated his ruler, Duke Li. In the fifteenth year, he rescued Zheng and defeated the Jin army at Li.

Between the Huai and Si rivers were more than ten small states. Chu and Wei bordered Qin. Wei built a long wall from Zheng along the Luo River northward, possessing the Shangjun commandery. Chu, from Hanzhong, possessed Ba and Qianzhong to the south. The Zhou royal house was weak, the feudal lords ruled by force, and competed in annexing each other. Qin was isolated in Yongzhou, did not participate in the alliances of the central states' feudal lords, and was treated like the Yi and Di. Duke Xiao thereupon spread benevolence, aided orphans and widows, recruited warriors, and made clear rewards for merit. He issued an order throughout the state, saying: "In the past, our Duke Mu, from between Qi and Yong, cultivated virtue and practiced martial arts, pacified the Jin disorder in the east, made the Yellow River the border, became hegemon of the Rong and Di in the west, expanded territory by a thousand li, was acknowledged as hegemon by the Son of Heaven, and all feudal lords congratulated him, establishing a foundation for later generations, which was exceedingly glorious and beautiful. Due to the instability during the reigns of the late Dukes Li, Zao, Jian, and Chuzi, the state suffered internal worries and had no time for external affairs. The three Jin states attacked and seized our former lord's land west of the Yellow River, and the feudal lords belittled Qin; there is no greater shame. When Duke Xian ascended the throne, he pacified the borders, moved the capital to Liyang, and intended to campaign eastward to recover Duke Mu's old territory and restore Duke Mu's policies. I constantly think of my former lord's intentions and feel pain in my heart. If any guests or ministers can propose an extraordinary plan to strengthen Qin, I will honor them with high office and share land with them." Thereupon, he dispatched troops eastward to besiege Shancheng and westward to behead King Huan of the Rong.

Yang said: "The failure of the laws to be implemented stems from the noble relatives. If Your Lordship truly wishes to implement the laws, start with the crown prince. The crown prince cannot be tattooed, so tattoo his tutors." Thereupon, the laws were greatly enforced, and the people of Qin were well-governed.
